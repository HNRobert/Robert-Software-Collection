<a name="How to Use This Manual"></a>
<h2>How to Use This Manual</h2>

<p>Familiarity with the Windows interface, such as property windows, tool
bars, scroll bars, etc., is recommended before reading this manual.

<p>For those who are unfamiliar with digital audio,
<a href="#Appendix: An Introduction to Digital Audio">Appendix A</a> briefly
introduces some of the fundamentals of computer audio.
<a href="#Appendix: Tutorial">Appendix D</a> gives a tutorial for
recording audio from a turntable, removing noise, and splitting
the file into tracks for CD-R burning.
<a href="#Appendix: Troubleshooting">Appendix E</a> contains
troubleshooting information and answers to common questions.

<p><a href="#Getting Started">Section II: Getting Started</a>, covers system requirements and installation.

<a name="Notation"></a>
<h2>Notation</h2>

<p><b>Bold</b> or link coloured text and a vertical bar are used to denote menu commands.
<b>File&nbsp;|&nbsp;New</b>, for example, means to select the <b>New</b> command from the <b>File</b>
menu.  This notation is used to refer to other sections within this manual as
well.  In the above example, you can find information by looking for <b>New</b>
under the <b>File Menu Commands</b> section.  If the first word is <b>Start</b>,
then select the command from the main Windows task bar menu structure instead.

<p>Options and settings are given in a <tt>fixed width</tt> font or
in quotes.

<img class="note" src="note.png" alt="Note">
A information icon emphasizes helpful information and techniques.
</p>

<p class="warn">
<img class="warn" src="warn.png" alt="Warning">
An exclamation mark emphasizes warnings and other important information.
</p>

<a name="Getting Started"></a>
<h1>II. Getting Started</h1>
<p>The following sections give instructions for installing and configuring
GoldWave on your computer.

</p>
<a name="System Requirements"></a>
<h2>System Requirements</h2>

<p>The minimum system requirements for GoldWave are:

<ul>
  <li> Pentium based PC or compatible</li>
  <li> Microsoft<sup>&#174;</sup> Windows<sup>&#174;</sup> ME, 2000, XP or later</li>
  <li> 128 Megabytes of RAM (256 MB recommended)</li>
  <li> 100 Megabytes of hard disk space</li>
  <li> Mouse</li>
  <li> Sound card with a Windows compatible driver</li>
</ul>

<p>If you need to edit large files, you will need a large amount of  hard drive
space.  One minute of CD-quality sound requires 20 megabytes of storage.
Editing a full CD requires at least 1GB of storage.

<p> For editing audio in movie files and editing <b>mp3</b> files,
you must have a recent version of Windows Media Player installed.

</p>
<a name="Installation"></a>
<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>The following section gives instructions for installing GoldWave on
your system.  Before running GoldWave make sure that you have an
appropriate Windows sound driver installed.  If you need to add one,
use the "Add New
Hardware" item under <b>Start&nbsp;|&nbsp;Settings&nbsp;|&nbsp;Control Panel</b>.  The driver and
installation instructions should be included with your sound card.  The
current settings for your sound card are listed under the "Sound, video, and
game controllers" item of the Device Manager.  The Device Manager is
found under "My Computer" <b>Properties</b> or the
<b>System</b> icon in the Control Panel.

</p>
<a name="Installation From a Downloaded Program (Exe) File"></a>
<h3>Installation From a Downloaded Program (Exe) File</h3>

<p>If you downloaded the self-installing version of GoldWave, simply
run the download.  It prompts you to provide a destination folder where GoldWave
will be installed.  A desktop shortcut and Windows <b>Start</b> menu items are
created automatically, if desired.

</p>
<a name="General Installation Instructions"></a>

<a name="Using GoldWave"></a>
<h1>III. Using GoldWave</h1>
<p>The following sections give information about GoldWave's user
interface, features, and menu structure.  The first few sections provide
general overviews, while subsequent sections provide details on menu
commands.

</p>
<a name="Interface Overview"></a>
<h2>Interface Overview</h2>

<p>GoldWave is composed of three windows: the Main window, Sound windows,
and the Control window.

<h3><a name="Interface Main Window">Main Window</a></h3>
<p>The Main window contains the
main menu, two rows of tool bar buttons, and status bars (see Main
Window figure below).  It
groups together and manages all the Sound windows.

<a name="Figure Main Window"></a>
<p><center><img src="main.png" width="716" height="504" alt="Main Window"><br>
Figure: Main Window</center>

<h3><a name="Interface Tool Bar">Tool Bar</a></h3>

<p>The tool bar buttons provide quick access to many of the frequently used
commands.
The upper bar holds File, Edit, View, and Tool commands, while the
lower bar contains Effect commands.  The function of each
button is displayed in the lower status bar when the mouse pointer is
positioned directly over it.  Use the
<a href="#Options Tool Bar">Options | Tool Bar</a> command to
configure the tool bar.

<h3><a name="Interface Status Bar">Status Bar</a></h3>

<p>The status bars show attributes of the Sound window, including the
sampling rate, length, selected region, channels, and general file format
information.  By right-clicking the mouse pointer over any status item that has
a menu icon on its right side, the unit or format for that status item can be
changed.  If you right-click the mouse pointer over the length item, for example,
you are presented with a menu showing length in terms of storage size,
time, and samples.  If you right-click on the channels item, then you
can select a single channel or both channels of a stereo file.

<a name="Figure Status Bar"></a>
<p><center><img src="statusbar.png" width="596" height="43" alt="Status Bar Contents"><br>
Figure: Status Bar Contents</center>

<h3><a name="Interface Sound Windows">Sound Windows</a></h3>

<p>Sound windows are created when you open a file.  These windows contain
a waveform graph of the sound with a time axis near the bottom.  For stereo
sounds, two separate graphs are shown.  The top green graph is the left
channel and the bottom red graph is the right channel.  The selected part of
the sound is highlighted with a blue background between two cyan markers.
A white, vertical line shows the current playback position within the sound.
This line is the <em>playback cursor</em>.

<p>A <a href="#Tool Cue Points">cue point</a> slot is located just
below the graph.  Cue points are shown as inverted yellow and
blue triangles.  Overlapping cue points are shown in slightly different
colours.

<p>Near the bottom of the Sound window, a small Overview area shows
the entire sound with the selected part in highlighted
green and/or red with a blue background and the rest with a black
background.  A beveled frame indicates what part of the sound
is currently displayed and zoomed.
Initially, the entire sound is selected.

<p>You can change the selection by using the mouse buttons or the keyboard.  See
<a href="#Editing Overview">Editing Overview</a> for details.
You can configure the window size and axes format of Sound windows
using the <a href="#Options Window">Options&nbsp;|&nbsp;Window</a>
command.  The <a href="#Options Colour">Options&nbsp;|&nbsp;Colours</a>
command sets the colour scheme.

<h3><a name="Interface Control Window">Control Window</a></h3>

<p>The Control window interacts directly with your sound card.  It
contains buttons to play and record sounds as well as controls for volume,
balance, and playback speed.  Real-time visuals display audio data
whenever a sound is played or recorded.  See
<a href="#Control Overview">Control Overview</a> for more details.

<h3><a name="Interface Progress Window">Progress Window</a></h3>

<p>When performing time consuming processing, such as decoding a compressed
file when opening it, or encoding a file when saving it, or using most
effects, a
progress window appears showing the amount of processing done and
the estimated time remaining to complete it.  Use the Cancel button to
abort processing at any time.  Use the Priority setting to reduce the load
on the computer's processor to give more time to other programs.

<p class="note">
<img class="note" src="note.png" alt="Note">
Some poorly designed (or overclocked) computers overheat when
performing complex processing, such as Noise
Reduction and saving in MP3 or other compressed formats.  Reducing the
Priority setting helps to avoid thermal related errors.
</p>


<h3><a name="Interface Mouse Wheel">Mouse Wheel</a></h3>

<p>In GoldWave the mouse wheel supports zooming, scrolling and selection,
or playback speed adjustments.  Click the middle mouse button
or the wheel button to display a menu to configure the behaviour
of the mouse wheel.  The mouse wheel works only when the Main
window is active and only on the currently active
<a href="#Interface Sound Windows">Sound window</a>.

<div class="in">
<h4><a name="Wheel Zooming">Zoom In/Out</a></h4>

<p>Zooms in and out of the waveform when the wheel is rotated
up or down.  The location of the mouse pointer is used
as the focal point.  Position the mouse over the area of interest
when using the wheel.  See
<a href="#View Menu Commands">View Menu Commands</a> for information
about viewing parts of the waveform in more detail.

<h4><a name="Wheel Scrolling">Scroll and Select</a></h4>

<p>When zoomed in, rotating the wheel up or down scrolls the
waveform left or right.  Holding the shift key moves the start
marker.  Holding both the
shift and control keys moves the finish marker.  Holding just the control
key scrolls vertically, when zoomed in vertically.
See <a href="#Editing Overview">Editing Overview</a> for more information
about selecting part of a file.

<h4><a name="Wheel Speed">Playback Speed</a></h4>

<p>Increases or decreases the playback speed by changing the Speed fader
on the Control window.
</div>


<h3><a name="Interface Entering Times">Entering Times</a></h3>

<p>GoldWave displays and accepts several different time formats.  The time
is separated into hours (H), minutes (M), seconds (S), and fractions of
a second, like thousandths (T).  Two digits are given for hours, minutes,
and seconds.  Zero or more digits are given for the fractional part.
The basic format looks like this: <tt>HH:MM:SS.TTTTT</tt>.  When using this
format, minutes and seconds must be numbers from 0 to 59.  Only five digits
can be given after the decimal point.  Other supported formats are given
in the following table.

<p><center><b>Table: Time Formats</b></center>

		<td valign="top">Hours, minutes, seconds, and fractions of a second.
		MM and SS must be between 0 to 59, inclusive.  A decimal must
		be used to separate fractions of
		a second from seconds.  Colons must be used to separate hours,
		minutes, and seconds.  All values are
		optional.  A time can be entered as <tt>HH::</tt> to specify hours
		only, or <tt>MM:</tt> to specify minutes only.

	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top"><tt>HH:MM:SS.XX/YY</tt></td>
		<td valign="top">Hours, minutes, seconds, and frames.
		This is the same as the first format, but instead of providing
		fractions of a second as a decimal, frames are used.  The numerator,
		XX, specifies the frame number and the denominator, YY, specifies the
		frame rate, such as 30 for a 30fps animation, or 75 for CD frames.
		If HH, MM, and SS are not given, then XX may be greater than YY
		to specify any frame.  Otherwise XX must be smaller than YY.
		Refer to the examples below.

<h2><a name="Control Overview">Control Overview</a></h2>

<p>The Control window (see Control Window figure) is the interface to
your audio hardware and drivers.  On the bottom half of the window are
visuals which display sound during playback and recording.  On
the top left area of the window is a standard set of audio controls,
including play, stop, record, rewind, pause, and fast forward.  A status
visual is located just below these controls.  In the top right area of the
window are controls to set the playback device's volume, balance, and
speed.  A level visual is located just below these.

<p class="note">

<p>	<b>Fast/Rewind Speed</b><br>
The playback speed of the fast forward and rewind buttons is
controlled by these values.  A value of 1.00 is normal speed.
Entering a value of 3.00 for <tt>Rewind speed</tt>, for example, means the
rewind button will play the sound backwards three times faster than
normal.  By entering small numbers (such as 0.1) the rewind and
fast forward buttons will play very slowly.  This is useful for
finding pops or clicks, since the visuals will move slowly
through the data.

<p>	<b>Marker preview</b><br>
Marker preview (scrubbing) plays a very short section of audio
whenever an edit marker is
moved with the <a href="#Accessibility Editing">keyboard</a>

<p><tt><a name="level activated">Level activated</a></tt>
recording is useful for automatically synchronizing recording to a
sound source or efficiently capturing airport or police radio communications
containing mostly silence that does not need to be recorded.
It automatically starts recording when the sound source is above a given level
and pauses recording when the sound is below the level.
The <tt>Threshold</tt> specifies
how loud a sound should be before recording
begins.  A value less than 0.2 is typical.  The
<tt>Duration</tt> time specifies how long to record after the
sound becomes quiet again.  Using a value of 3 allows recording to
continue for three seconds after the sound goes below the specified
threshold.  To minimize silence, use a value of 1 second or
less, but not zero.  A zero value causes recording to continue without
stopping once triggered.  The <tt>Prebuffer</tt> time specifies the amount of
audio to store prior to activation.  When activation occurs, the prebuffer
audio is inserted before the currently recorded audio, allowing you to hear the
sound slightly before activation.  The
<tt>Time stamp cues</tt> option provides a way of marking the date,
time, and position of each activation.  Cue points with the current
date and time are created and can be view under the
<a href="#Tool Cue Points">Cue Points</a> tool.  Use the edit box to specify
the format for the date (this is done using the C strftime function).  Some
format specifiers are given below.

<h4><a name="Volume Properties">Volume Properties</a></h4>

<p>The Volume Properties page lets you adjust
recording volumes and select or unselect recording sources.  Be sure to
select the correct volume device that corresponds with the recording device
selected under the <a href="#Device Properties">Device</a> tab.

<p>A volume fader, edit box, and checkbox is shown for each source.  To select a
source, check the appropriate checkbox.  If your sound card
supports a master control, make sure that the <tt>Mute all</tt> option
is turned off and that the master volume is not zero.


<p>You can use the <tt>Monitor input</tt>
option under the <a href="#Record Properties">Record</a>
tab to activate the visuals without recording.

<p>Note that volumes are changed regardless of whether you choose
OK or Cancel to close the Properties window.

<p>To select a different recording device, use the
<a href="#Device Properties">Device</a> tab.

<a name="Visual Properties"></a>
<h4>Visual Properties</h4>

<p>	The Visual Properties page controls what visuals are used in
what location.  There are four visuals: status, level, left, and right.
The status visual is located at the upper left side.  It displays
elapsed time and playback and recording status.  The level visual
is located at the upper right side.  It graphically displays the current output
or input level.  The left and right visuals display audio in a variety
of ways, as listed in the table.

are in phase, the pattern is a diagonal line running from
the lower left to the upper right.  If the channels are 90 degrees
out of phase, the pattern is a circle.  For general stereo
sounds, it looks like a crazy scribble.  The larger the scribble,
the larger the difference between the channels.  Monaural sounds
always show a diagonal line since the left and right data
are the same.</td></tr>

<p>	Some visuals have properties you can set, such as axes ranges, colours,
display modes, etc.  Right-click on a visual and select <tt>Properties</tt>
from the popup menu to see these properties. You can resize the Control
window to make the visuals larger or smaller.

<p>	<b>Quick Select Menu</b><br>
Use the quick select menu list to select your favourite visuals.  The selected
visuals appear in the popup menu when you right-click on a visual in the Control
window.

<p><b>Frame Rate</b><br>
The frame rate sets the number of times per second that
visuals are updated and drawn.  A value of 60 or less
gives good results, but you may want to use higher values to get an extra
detailed spectrogram.  The actual frame rate is limited by your system's
speed.  Use a lower frame rate for older systems.

<p><b>FFT Window</b><br>
When calculating any frequency related graphs, a window function
must be used to smooth out analysis at the endpoints.  The Kaiser 7 or Hamming
windows are usually the best, but you can try the other windows
just to compare the results.

</p>
<a name="Device Properties"></a>
<h4>Device Properties</h4>

<p>	The Device Properties page contains drop down lists for playback and
recording devices.  Normally you do
not need to change these settings unless you have more than one
sound card or you encounter a problem.

<p> The
<tt>Quality</tt> settings control the <a href="#Bits">bit depth</a>
to use.  Most cards
support 16 bit quality, but more recent cards support 24 bit
quality.  Sound card drivers on recent versions of Windows should
support the IEEE 32 bit floating point setting, but often that is
not the case, so that setting should not be used until properly
supported by the industry (probably never).

<p>The playback <tt>Prebuffer/latency</tt> fader sets the amount of audio
to store before sending it to the device.  Using a higher value may
eliminate gaps and stutters on a slow system, but it increases the
delay between changing effect settings and hearing those changes during
previewing.  Using lower values makes effect previewing more responsive,
but may cause gaps and stutters if the system is too slow to process all the
audio or emulated DirectX drivers are selected. This setting does not apply
to recording.  Values between 0.4 and 0.8 are recommended.

<p> The <tt>Alternative playback initialization</tt> option helps
to avoid some of
the many problems with sound drivers and can eliminate deadlock (freezes)
when previewing certain DirectX Audio Plug-ins.  It eliminates a
loud click that occurs at the start of playback on some drivers.
This option causes the DirectX sound buffer to be recreated each time
playback is started rather than reusing the same buffer.  It begins
playback on a separate thread without pausing or holding up
the main program thread.  This makes the interface seem more responsive
when starting playback.

<p>The <tt>Mono source</tt> options specify the channel to use when
recording a mono file: <tt>Left channel</tt> captures audio on the
left channel only;  <tt>Right channel</tt>
captures audio on the right channel only; <tt>Average</tt> captures audio
on both channels and averages it into a single channel.

<p><tt>Joystick control</tt> allows playback and recording to be
controlled using a game controller or a foot pedal.  The first
controller detected is used.
The following table lists the modes of operation.

<a name="Playing Sounds"></a>
<h3>Playing Sounds</h3>

<p>After opening a sound (see <a href="#Open">File&nbsp;|&nbsp;Open</a>), you use the
green play <img src="playgreen.png" width="33" height="17" align="bottom" alt="Green Play">
button
or the yellow play
<img src="playyellow.png" width="33" height="17" align="bottom" alt="Yellow Play"> button
to play it.  Both buttons play the selection by default, but you can configure these
buttons under the
<a href="#Play Properties">Play</a> tab of the Control Properties window to
play different parts of the file.
Right-click on the button to quickly access some of those settings.

<p>To start playback at any point in the sound, click on the
time line under the waveform in the
<a href="#Interface Sound Windows">Sound window</a>
or right-click on
the waveform and choose the <b>Play From Here</b> command from the popup
menu.  You can right-click-and-drag to select a part of the sound to
play as well.

<p>While a sound is playing, it is displayed on the visuals.  The current
position is displayed in the Sound
window as a white, vertical line on the waveform (cursor).  You can move
the start and finish selection
markers to the playback position by using the bracket keys, <b>[</b> and <b>]</b> or
<a href="#Marker Drop Start/Finish">Edit&nbsp;|&nbsp;Marker&nbsp;|&nbsp;Drop...</a> commands.  See
<a href="#Editing Overview">Editing Overview</a> for more
information about changing the selection.  You can set cue points by using
the Ctrl+Q key or the
<a href="#Drop Cue">Edit&nbsp;|&nbsp;Cue&nbsp;Point&nbsp;|&nbsp;Drop&nbsp;Cue</a>
command.

<p class="note">
<img class="note" src="note.png" alt="Note">

Remember to use either play or stop later.  Pause freezes the visuals
and the current position marker so you can see the shape of the sound in
the visuals or move the selection markers.

</p>
<a name="Stopping Playback"></a>
<h3>Stopping Playback</h3>

<p>Playback can be stopped immediately with the stop
<img src="stop.png" width="33" height="17" align="bottom" alt="Stop">
button.  The current
position is reset to the beginning.  Note that recording is stopped using a
different button.

as a white, vertical
line on the waveform.  You can adjust the speed of rewind and fast forward with the
<a href="#Play Properties">Play</a> tab of the Control Properties window, as described
previously.

</p>
<a name="Recording Sounds"></a>
<h3>Recording Sounds</h3>

<p>Use the record
<img src="record.png" width="33" height="17" align="bottom" alt="Record">
button to record your own sounds.  Before you start, you
need to create a new file using the <a href="#New">File&nbsp;|&nbsp;New</a>
command.  You can make room for recording in an existing sound
by using the <a href="#Insert Silence">Edit&nbsp;|&nbsp;Insert&nbsp;Silence</a>
command.  Audio is recorded into the selection of the
<a href="#Interface Sound Windows">Sound window</a>
replacing any audio that was
previously there.  Recording stops automatically when the end of the
selection is reached (<a href="#bounded mode">bounded mode</a>) or
when no more storage is available (<a href="#unbounded mode">unbounded
mode</a>).  You can stop recording at any time with the
recording stop

button.  A recording pause
<img src="recpause.png" width="33" height="17" align="bottom" alt="Recording Pause">
buttons appears in place of the record button so
that you can pause recording.
Many recording options are available in the
<a href="#Record Properties">Record</a> tab of the Control Properties window.
Right-click on the record button to quickly access some of these options.

<p>Sound cards usually have several recording sources, such as microphone, line-in,
CD, and MIDI.  To select and adjust a recording source, use the
<a href="#Volume Properties">Volume</a> tab of the Control Properties window or the
Windows Volume Control accessory.  To use the Volume Control accessory,
use <b>Start&nbsp;|&nbsp;Programs&nbsp;|
Accessories&nbsp;| Entertainment&nbsp;|&nbsp;Volume Control</b> (it may be
under <b>Multimedia</b>).

Next, use the <b>Options&nbsp;|&nbsp;Properties</b>
command in the Volume Control window.  In the Properties window, select the
Recording option and make sure all the items in the list are checked.
Finally, choose OK to see the Recording Control.  You can select a recording source and adjust the
volume.  To adjust the volume before recording, use the <a href="#monitor input">Monitor input</a> option
under the <a href="#Record Properties">Record</a> tab of the Control Properties window.

<p>Remember to press the playback button on the cassette player, record player,
or CD player when recording from an external device.  See the
<a href="#Appendix: Tutorial">Appendix D</a> for a tutorial.

<p>If you want to record vocals over existing music, you'll need to
use two files in GoldWave.  You can record in one file while playing the other.
Some sound cards have a "Stereo Mix" (or "What U Hear" or similar)
recording source you can select
that will allow you to record both the microphone input and the playing
sound at the same time.  If that source is not available, you'll need to
<a href="#Mixing">mix</a>
the two files after recording instead.

<p class="warn">
<img class="warn" src="warn.png" alt="Warning">
For long recordings, turn off any power management settings that may

<a name="Volume and Balance Faders"></a>
<h3>Volume and Balance Faders</h3>

<p>Use the top volume fader
to change the playback volume.  Move the fader
right or click the plus button to increase the volume.  Move it left to
decrease the volume.  The current volume is shown numerically in a popup
tip window to the left of the fader.  A value of 100% is full volume.

<p>Use the middle balance fader to change the left/right balance.
Move the fader in the direction you want to shift the balance.  Right-click
on the fader to display a popup menu to quickly set the balance left,
right, or center.

<p>Note that these faders <b>do not</B> change the recording volume.  See

<a name="Speed Fader"></a>
<h3>Speed Fader</h3>

<p>The playback speed of the audio device can be changed with the bottom speed
fader.  Move the fader right to increase the speed, and left to decrease
it.  The relative speed is shown numerically to the left of the fader in
a popup tip window.  Right-click on the fader to display a popup menu
to quickly set the speed to commonly used ratios.  Note that changing
the speed also changes the pitch like spinning a vinyl record faster or

</p>
<a name="Editing Overview"></a>
<h2>Editing Overview</h2>

<a name="Selecting Part of a Sound"></a>
<h3>Selecting Part of a Sound</h3>

<p>Almost all commands in GoldWave operate on the currently selected part
of a sound.  The selected part, or <em>selection</em>, is the highlighted part of the
sound graph between two vertical markers (see
<a href="#Figure Main Window">Main Window</a> figure).  The vertical markers are
cyan lines located to the left side (<em>start</em> marker) and right side (<em>finish</em>
marker) of the view.

<p>
GoldWave provides several ways of setting the selection.  You can:
<ul>
<li> Use the standard click-and-drag method used in most other Windows programs.
<li> Click the right mouse button to display a menu where you can choose Set Start Marker or Set Finish Marker.
<li> Click-and-drag the left mouse button over one of the cyan markers to drag it (useful for precise adjustments of the end points).
<li> Click-and-drag using the right mouse button, then choose Select from the menu that appears.
<li> Use the <a href="#Marker Set">Edit&nbsp;|&nbsp;Marker&nbsp;|&nbsp;Set</a> command.
<li> Use the <a href="#Channel">Edit&nbsp;|&nbsp;Channel</a> submenu to select one channel of a stereo file.
<li> Use the keyboard.  See <a href="#Accessibility Overview">Accessibility Overview</a>
for details.
</ul>

<p>If you just click the left mouse button without dragging, the start marker
is moved.  If you just click the right mouse button, a context menu appears,
which can be used to start playback at any position.  If you click-and-drag
with the right mouse button, you can play or zoom in on that area
without altering the current selection.


<p>Additional notes and techniques:

<ul>
  <li> To use the old style of selecting part of a sound (in v4 and
earlier), enable the setting under the
<a href="#Options Window">Options&nbsp;|&nbsp;Window</a> command.  Note
that none of the new selection features work if you enable
that setting.
  <li> You cannot place the finish marker before the start marker.  The
same is true for setting the start marker after the finish marker.</li>
  <li> Mouse selection methods work in both the large sound graph
or in the small Overview graph.
  <li> The
<a href="#Marker Snap to zero-crossing">Edit&nbsp;|&nbsp;Marker&nbsp;|&nbsp;Snap&nbsp;to&nbsp;zero-crossing</a>
feature helps to minimize pops and clicks between edit points by finding a point where the waveform is
close to zero amplitude.</li>
  <li> To select a certain part of the sound while playing it by using
the <b>[</b> and <b>]</b> (bracket) keys or the
<b>Drop</b> commands under the <a href="#Marker">Edit&nbsp;|&nbsp;Marker</a>
submenu.  You can use the rewind and fast forward buttons to quickly
find a sound.</li>
  <li> In most cases, editing and effects are performed only on the
selection.  Some effects, such as the
<a href="#Resample">Resample</a>, and
<a href="#Playback Rate">Playback Rate</a>
alter the entire sound.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Redrawing the Waveform with the Mouse"></a>
<h3>Redrawing the Waveform with the Mouse</h3>

<p>You can redraw the waveform with the mouse to remove pops/clicks or other
small defects.  To do this, you must first zoom in so that
individual samples are visible (see
<a href="#Zoom 1:1">View&nbsp;|&nbsp;Zoom 1:1</a>
or <a href="#Zoom 10:1">View&nbsp;|&nbsp;Zoom 10:1</a>).

<ol>
  <li> Zoom in 1:1 or closer.</li>
  <li> Place the mouse arrow directly over the waveform.  The
arrow will change into a target crosshair.
</li>
  <li> Click and hold the left mouse button.</li>
  <li> Move the mouse to redraw the waveform.</li>
  <li> Release the mouse button to finish the changes.</li>
</ol>

<a name="Cut and Paste, Mixing, and Crossfading"></a>
<h3>Cut &amp; Paste, Mixing, and Crossfading</h3>

<p>Cutting and pasting audio in GoldWave works much the same way as
cutting and pasting text in a word processor.
Mixing and cross-fading involves combining two or more sound together
so that they play at the same time.

</p>
<div class="in">
<a name="Cut n Paste"></a>
<h4>Cut &amp; Paste</h4>
<p>The <a href="#Cut">Edit&nbsp;|&nbsp;Cut</a> command removes
sections of audio.  The
<a href="#Paste">Edit&nbsp;|&nbsp;Paste</a> command inserts sections
of audio from the clipboard.  Before you can paste, you need to use
<a href="#Cut">Edit&nbsp;|&nbsp;Cut</a> or
<a href="#Copy">Edit&nbsp;|&nbsp;Copy</a> to place some audio into
the clipboard.

<p>To join several files together:
<ol>
  <li> Open the first song.</li>
  <li> Open the second song.</li>
  <li> Choose <b>Copy</b> from the <b>Edit</b> menu.</li>
  <li> Close the second song.</li>
  <li> Choose <b>End</b> from the <b>Edit | Paste At</b> submenu.</li>
  <li> Open the third song.</li>
  <li> Choose <b>Copy</b> from the <b>Edit</b> menu.</li>
  <li> Close the third song.</li>
  <li> Choose <b>End</b> from the <b>Edit | Paste At</b> submenu.</li>
  <li> Repeat steps 6 to 9 for each song you want to join.
</ol>

If you want to split a large file into smaller section, use the
<a href="#Tool Cue Points">Cue Points</a> tool, which has a
Split File button.
</div>

<a name="Mixing"></a>
<div class="in">
<h4>Mixing</h4>

<p>The <a href="#Mix">Edit&nbsp;|&nbsp;Mix</a>
command mixes one sound with another so they both play
at the same time.

<p>To add vocals to music:
<ol>
  <li> Open the sound containing the vocals.</li>
  <li> Choose <b>Copy</b> from the <b>Edit</b> menu.</li>
  <li> Open the sound containing the music.</li>
  <li> Choose <b>Mix</b> from the <b>Edit</b> menu.</li>
  <li> Enter a volume to mix the vocals (0dB = full volume).</li>
  <li> Adjust the mix time to align the vocals with the music, using
the preview button as needed.</li>
  <li> Choose OK to process the mix.</li>
</ol>

<p class="note">
<img class="note" src="note.png" alt="Note">
When mixing more than a couple of sounds, you should reduce the
mixing volume and the destination volume to prevent clipping
distortion.  The volume of the destination sound can be reduced
before mixing by using the
<a href="#Change Volume">Effect&nbsp;|&nbsp;Volume&nbsp;|&nbsp;Change&nbsp;Volume</a>
command.
</div>

<a name="Crossfading"></a>
<div class="in">
<h4>Crossfading</h4>
<p>A crossfade occurs when one sound fades out while another sound fades in.
Radio stations often use crossfades to fade out the end of one song while
fading in the next song so there is no break in the music.  GoldWave's
<a href="#Crossfade">Edit&nbsp;|&nbsp;Crossfade</a> command does
the same thing by using the clipboard audio as the second song.  The entire
song to fade in must be <a href="#Copy">copied</a> to the clipboard
before using the command.

<p>To do a crossfade in GoldWave, follow these steps:
<ol>
<li> Open the first song (the one that will fade out at the end).</li>
<li> Open the second song (the one that will fade in at the beginning).</li>
<li> Choose <b>Copy</b> from the <b>Edit</b> menu.</li>
<li> Close the second song (or activate the first song window).</li>
<li> Choose <b>Crossfade</b> from the <b>Edit</b> menu.</li>
<li> Set <b>Duration</b> to 5.00 second (or whatever you prefer).</li>
<li> Select the <b>End of file</b>, and <b>Linear</b> fade curves settings.</li>
<li> Choose OK to process the mix.</li>
</ol>

<p>In some cases more control is needed.  To do a crossfade manually
in GoldWave, follow these steps:

<p><center><img src="crossfade.png" width=203 height=72 alt="Crossfade"><br>
Figure: Crossfade</center>

<ol>
  <li> Open the first song.</li>
  <li> Move the start marker to select the last 3 seconds of the song.</li>
  <li> Choose <b>Fade out</b> from the <b>Effects&nbsp;|&nbsp;Volume</b> sub menu and use a
&minus;160dB final volume.</li>
  <li> Open the second song.</li>
  <li> Move the finish marker to select the first 3 seconds of the song.</li>
  <li> Choose <b>Fade in</b> from the <b>Effects&nbsp;|&nbsp;Volume</b> sub menu and use an
initial volume of &minus;160dB.</li>
  <li> Choose <b>Select all</b> from the <b>Edit</b> menu.</li>
  <li> Choose <b>Copy</b> from the <b>Edit</b> menu.</li>
  <li> Click on the first song to activate that
	<a href="#Interface Sound Windows">Sound window</a>.</li>
  <li> Choose <b>Mix</b> from the <b>Edit</b> menu and use
  a volume of 0dB.</li>
  <li> Choose OK to process the mix.</li>

<h2><a name="Storage Overview">Storage Overview</a></h2>

<p>GoldWave supports both hard drive based editing and RAM based editing.
These features are described below.  Hard drive storage is enabled by default.
Use the <a href="#Options Storage">Options&nbsp;|&nbsp;Storage</a>
to configure the storage mode.   For uncompressed files, GoldWave will
read the audio directly from the original file.  It does not copy a file
to temporary storage until it is edited or modified.  The original
file is not changed until it is saved.  For most compressed files, the
data has to be decompressed to temporary storage when the file
is opened.

<p> Working with compressed
files may take much more storage than expected.  MP3 files, for example,
have to be decompressed into temporary storage before GoldWave can edit
them.  Such files may require over 20 times the amount of compressed storage
when opened. A 10MB MP3 file could require over 200MB of storage space.

</p>
<a name="Storage Hard Drive"></a>
<h3>Hard Drive</h3>

<p>In hard drive based editing, the entire sound is stored in a
temporary file on your hard drive where it can be modified.  This allows
you to edit huge files provided the required drive space is available.  Only
a small amount of RAM is required for each opened sound.  The
drawback is that editing and effects processing take more
time since audio data must be transferred to and from the drive.

</p>
<a name="Storage RAM"></a>
<h3>RAM</h3>

<p>In RAM based editing, the entire sound is stored in your
computer's memory.  This allows you to edit and process files very
quickly.  It saves time and reduces the load on your hard drive.  The
drawback is that the size of the files must be small enough to fit
in the available RAM.  If you edit or record large files, Windows
will start swapping memory to the hard drive, which significantly degrades
performance and may cause defects when recording.
Also note that in the event of a system crash, it will not be
possible to recover a file stored in RAM.  Editing files larger
than 1GB in RAM is not recommended due to limitations in Windows.

</p>
<a name="File Overview"></a>
<h2>File Overview</h2>

<p>This section explains file formats and gives general information
about how files are handled by GoldWave.  Several
features for storing and handling files can be configured using
<a href="#Options Storage">Options&nbsp;|&nbsp;Storage</a> and
<a href="#Options File Formats">Options&nbsp;|&nbsp;File&nbsp;Formats</a>.

</p>
<a name="File Format"></a>
<h3>File Format</h3>

<p>Sound files come in a variety of forms.  Usually, the form or
<em>type</em> of sound
can be determined from its filename extension, such
as <tt>.wav</tt> or <tt>.mp3</tt>.
GoldWave supports all the sound types listed in the Supported File Types table, and
more depending on what file format <a href="#File Format Plug-ins">plug-ins</a>
are installed.  Each file type can
have several sub-formats or <em>attributes</em>.  The <tt>.wav</tt>
type for example, can hold
audio encoded or compressed in dozens of different ways, including PCM,
ADPCM, companded, or MPEG1 Layer 3.

<p>Normally, GoldWave detects and automatically opens all the supported file
types.  However, there are several cases where GoldWave may not be able
to open a file:

<ol>
  <li> The file does not contain any header information and there is no
file association (see
<a href="#Options File Formats">Options&nbsp;|&nbsp;File&nbsp;Formats</a>).</li>
  <li> The file type is recognized, but the file structure is invalid or
corrupt.</li>
  <li> The file uses a new compression method or format that GoldWave
does not recognize.</li>
  <li> The file type is not supported by GoldWave or any plug-ins.</li>
</ol>

<p>If any of these conditions occur, GoldWave displays the File Format window
(shown below) so that you can specify the type and attributes manually.  GoldWave
lists all the file format plug-ins that support reading raw audio data.  If
you are working with PCM or uncompressed binary data (like CD audio), select
the Raw type.
If you are working with Telephony files, select the Dialogic type.  Other
types may be listed depending on what plug-ins you have installed.

<p>If you do not know the format, experiment with trial-and-error.
<a href="#Appendix: An Introduction to Digital Audio">Appendix A</a>
has more information about sound attributes.  Start with
an 8 bit or 16 bit PCM attributes, then try the mu-law or A-law
formats.  Generally, sounds will be noisy if the format or number of bits is
incorrect, in which case you will have to close and reopen the sound using
a different format.  You can leave the sampling rate unchanged since it
affects only the playback speed and can be changed later using
<a href="#Playback Rate">Effects&nbsp;|&nbsp;Playback Rate</a>.


</p>
<a name="File Format Plug-ins"></a>
<h3>File Format Plug-ins</h3>

<p>GoldWave supports external file format plug-ins for opening and
saving files.  These plug-ins are created by other
developers by using the GoldWave Plug-in Development Kit to
handle file types that GoldWave does not support directly.

<p>You can use
<a href="#Options File Formats">Options&nbsp;|&nbsp;File&nbsp;Formats</a>
to enable and disable plug-ins or to change the order in which they are used.

<p>When you open a file in GoldWave, these steps are followed:

<ol>
<li> If the file type is a CD audio (CDA) track, you are
advised to use the CD Reader tool and no further processing occurs.
<li> For all other file types, the file is passed to each
file format plug-in module until one is able to handle the file.  The
order is configured under the File Plug-in Precedence tab of the File
Format Options window.
<li> If none of the plug-ins support the file format, then the
Undetectable Types list under the
<a href="#Options File Formats">File Format Options</a> window is used
to determine if type and attributes have been associated with the
file type.  If so, the file is open automatically using those attributes.
<li> If there are no associations, then the
<a href="#Figure File Format">File Format</a> window
(see previous section)
is displayed so that the attributes can be specified manually.  Chances
are that compressed files cannot be open and decoded properly unless
a new plug-in is installed for that file type.
</ol>

<a name="Effects Overview"></a>
<h2>Effects Overview</h2>

<p>Effects modify, enhance, and change sounds in a variety of ways.
These commands are similar to font menu commands in word processors.
For example, using font commands, you can change the size of the letters.
In GoldWave, using the <a href="#Change Volume">Volume&nbsp;|&nbsp;Change&nbsp;Volume</a> effect
changes the "size" of a sound.
Changing the colour of a font would be similar to changing the pitch of a
sound.

<p>For an introduction to
some of the terms used in this section, refer to the
<a href="#Editing Overview">Editing Overview</a>
section and
<a href="#Appendix: An Introduction to Digital Audio">Appendix A</a>.
A variety of <a href="#Volume Scales">volume scales</a> may be used by
effects.

<p>Most effects in GoldWave are cumulative.  This means that if
you use the same effect with the same settings, then the sound
is changed each time.  For example, if you use the
<a href="#Change Volume">Volume&nbsp;|&nbsp;Change&nbsp;Volume</a>
effect with a value
of -6.02dB, then the volume of the sound decreases to half its
current level.  If you use that effect again, the volume decrease
again, giving one quarter the original volume.

<p>Another example is the <a href="#Time Warp">Time Warp</a> effect.
If you specify a change of 50%, then time is slowed to half and the
sound is twice as long.  Using the effect again at 50% makes
the sound four times as long.

<p>There are a few exceptions.  The
<a href="#Maximize Volume">Maximize Volume</a> effect
has an absolute setting.  Maximizing the volume to 0dB sets the sound's
peak volume to 0dB.  Using the effect again at 0dB has no affect.

</p>
<a name="Common Controls for Effects"></a>
<h3>Common Controls for Effects</h3>

<p>Many effects have similar controls such as presets and shape boxes.  These
are explained below.

<a name="Figure Common Controls for Effects"></a>
<p><center><img src="effectcontrols.png" width="587" height="412" alt="Common Controls for Effects"><br>
Figure: Common Controls for Effects</center>

<p>

<div class="in">
<a name="Presets"></a>
<h4>Presets</h4>

<p>	Presets store settings, parameters, and
<a href="#Shape Controls">shapes</a> (described below) for quick retrieval
the next time
the effect or command is used.  Controls for presets consist of a drop down list
box, an add <img src="add.png" width="21" height="21" align="bottom" alt="Add">
button, and a remove <img src="remove.png" width="21" height="21" align="bottom" alt="Remove"> button,
as shown in the
<a href="#Figure Common Controls for Effects">figure</a> above.

<p>	To add a new preset:

<p>
<ol>
  <li> Enter in all the new parameters and/or draw the new shape.</li>
  <li> Type in a new name for the preset in the drop down list.
This name should be the same as one currently in the list unless you
intend to replace it.</li>
  <li> Choose the add <img src="add.png" width="21" height="21" align="bottom" alt="Add"> button.</li>
</ol>

<p>	To delete a preset:

<p>
<ol>
  <li> Select the preset from the drop down list.</li>
  <li> Choose the remove <img src="remove.png" width="21" height="21" align="bottom" alt="Remove"> button.</li>
  <li> Choose the Yes button to confirm deletion.
</ol>


<p>	To change a preset:

<p>
<ol>
  <li> Select the preset from the drop down list.</li>
  <li> Change the parameters.</li>
  <li> Choose the add <img src="add.png" width="21" height="21" align="bottom" alt="Add"> button.</li>
  <li> Choose the Yes button to overwrite the preset when prompted.
</ol>
</div>

<div class="in">
<a name="Shape Controls"></a>
<h4>Shape Controls</h4>

<p>	Several effects in GoldWave use Shape Controls to set graphical
parameters or dynamically alter the effect across the selection.
Shape Controls usually consist of a graph window and a set of
controls, including a point number box, an add point button, a remove
point button, an X value box, and a Y value box as shown in the
<a href="#Figure Common Controls for Effects">figure</a>
above.

<div class="in">
<p><b>Graph Window</b><br>
The graph window initially contains a single line with two
endpoints, shown as large dots.  By clicking the left mouse button
anywhere inside this window, you can add new points to bend the
line into a variety of zigzag shapes.  To move a point, click on it
and drag it to a new location.  To remove a point, click the right
mouse button over the point.  Note that endpoints cannot be
removed.

<p><b>Controls</b><br>
Points can be added, moved, and removed by using these controls.  Use the
<tt>Point</tt> box to select the current point.  Change the X and Y
values to move the point.  Use the <tt>add point</tt> button to insert a
new point between
the current point and the next point.  Use the <tt>remove point</tt> button
to remove the current point, except if it is an endpoint.
</div>

<p>Some dynamic effects, such as
<a href="#Doppler">Doppler</a>,
<a href="#Pan">Pan</a>, and
<a href="#Shape Volume">Shape Volume</a>
start
<a href="#Preview">previewing</a>
audio based on the current point's time value.  If the X
value of the current point is 1:00, for example, then preview playback
starts at that time rather than at the
beginning of the selection.  This lets you preview the point's
settings without playing the entire selection.

<p>To save a shape, use the <a href="#Presets">Presets</a> controls,
explained above.

</div>

<div class="in">
<a name="Preview"></a>
<h4>Preview Controls</h4>

<p> Previewing is a way of listening to how the current effect settings
will sound without having to process the entire
<a href="#Editing Overview">selection</a> first.
Preview Controls consist of a play
<img src="playgreen.png" width="33" height="17" align="bottom" alt="Play">
button and a stop
<img src="stop.png" width="33" height="17" align="bottom" alt="Stop">

button.  When
you press the play button previewing usually starts at the beginning
of the selection.
In some cases, such as effects that have time
based <a href="#Shape Controls">shapes</a>, previewing will start at
the current point's time rather than at the beginning of the
selection.
<p>In most cases, you can change the effect settings while the
preview plays and hear the changes as they are made.  For more
complex effects and most <a href="#Shape Controls">shape</a>
based effects, you will need to use
the <b>Apply</b> button to apply the changes or shape while
previewing.
</div>

<p class="note">
<img class="note" src="note.png" alt="Note">
The <b>Apply</b> button is used only for previewing.
It does not apply the effect to the sound file.  Use the <b>OK</b> button.
<p>

<a name="Effect Plug-ins"></a>
<h3>Effect Plug-ins</h3>
Effect plug-ins are modules developed by other companies that can
be used within GoldWave.  These appear under the
<a href="#Effect Plug-in">Effect&nbsp;|&nbsp;Plug-in</a> menu.
A DirectX plug-in wrapper is included with GoldWave to add
support for many of the existing DirectX Audio Plug-ins.  Other
plug-ins are designed to work with GoldWave directly and will
appear as separate items under the plug-in menu, each with its own
submenu of effects.  In some cases settings for
effect plug-ins can be changed using the
<a href="#Options Plug-ins">Options&nbsp;|&nbsp;Plug-in</a> menu.

<p class="warn">
<img class="warn" src="warn.png" alt="Warning">
If any errors or exceptions occur while using
a plug-in, you'll need to contact the plug-in creator
for assistance.  GoldWave Inc. does not provide support for
plug-ins created by separate developers.
</p>

<h2><a name="Accessibility Overview">Accessibility Overview</a></h2>
<p>This section outlines the accessibility features in GoldWave.  Almost all
of GoldWave's fuctionality is accessible through the keyboard.  See
<a href="#Appendix: Keyboard Commands">Keyboard Commands</a>
and <a href="#Options Keyboard">Options | Keyboard</a>.

<h3><a name="Accessibility Interface">Interface</a></h3>
If a screen reader is active when starting GoldWave, the program automatically
changes its interface slightly to be more screen reader friendly in a
couple of ways.

<p>The status visual in the <a href="#Interface Control Window">Control window</a>
becomes a text box that gives the elapsed time,
the current status, and the peak levels (in parentheses).  The peak levels are
updated only while holding the Ctrl key.  When the key is release the highest
level is shown.  The level is reset whenever the Ctrl key is press again.
The levels are given in percentages,
but tabbing to the text box and pressing <tt>D</tt> changes it to decibels.  Pressing
<tt>D</tt> again changes it back to percentages.

<p>All images are removed from the menus so that standard Windows text menu items
are used instead of custom drawn ones, ensuring that menus are easily
readable.  If menus cannot be read, be sure to uncheck the
"Tool bar images in menu" box under 
<a href="Options Tool Bar">Options | Tool Bar</a>.

<p>Almost all windows in GoldWave provide edit boxes where values and settings
can be entered rather than relying on visual controls only.  Use the <tt>Tab</tt> key
to move between controls.

<p>Use <tt>Alt+F6</tt> to switch between GoldWave's
<a href="#Interface Main Window">Main window</a>
and
<a href="#Interface Control Window">Control window</a>.  Use the <tt>Tab</tt> key to
move through the buttons and faders.  The arrow keys change the fader settings.
Unless you need to access the volume, balance, or speed faders,
it is best to dock the Control window.  Use the
<b>Tool | Control</b> command to dock or undock it.

<h3><a name="Accessibility Navigation">Navigation</a></h3>

<p>Finding certains parts of a sound file is done through keyboard navigation, which
involves playing the file and moving the playback cursor until the area if
interest is located.  GoldWave includes many keys for playing different parts
of the sound.  They are listed in the following table.  The amount that the
cursor is moved depends on the zoom level, explained in the 
<a href="#Accessibility View">View</a> section below.

<p>The <a href="#Auto Scroll Lock">View | Auto Scroll Lock</a> menu
item <b>must</b> be checked for keyboard navigation to work.

<p>In addition to
using the <a href="#Marker Set">Edit&nbsp;|&nbsp;Marker&nbsp;|&nbsp;Set</a>
and the 
<a href="#Marker Drop Start/Finish">Edit&nbsp;|&nbsp;Marker&nbsp;|&nbsp;Drop...</a>
commands, there are a number of ways of changing the
<a href="#Editing Overview">selection</a> with the keyboard.
They are listed in the following table.  The amount that the
selection markers are moved depends on the zoom level, explained in the 
<a href="#Accessibility View">View</a> section below.

</center>

<p>After deleting or cutting the selection, the selection is empty, so
if the playback buttons
are set to play the selection, nothing will play.  Use
<b>Ctrl+A</b> to select the entire file.

<p>Keep in mind that most of the playback keys stop playback at the finish marker
and there may be more audio beyond it.  Use <b>Edit | Trim</b> to
remove any audio outside the selection, if you only want to save what is in
the selection.

<p>If recording is stopped, the finish marker is moved to the stop time.
To continue recording from that point, use <b>Shift+End</b> to move the start
marker to the finish marker, then use 
<b>Ctrl+Shift+End</b> to move the finish marker to the end.  Starting
recording will continue from where it was stopped.

<h3><a name="Accessibility View">View</a></h3>

<p>The view and zoom level control how much audio is displayed on the screen (or page).
By default, GoldWave displays the entire file.  Use the
<a href="MenuView.html">View Menu Commands</a> to change the amount of
audio displayed.  This also changes the amount the playback cursor
and selection markers are moved with each keystroke.  The cursor is
moved one tenth of the screen size.  Selection markers are moved one hundredth
of the screen size.

Using
<b>View | 10 Seconds</b> displays 10 seconds of audio in the view.
The <tt>Page Up</tt> or <tt>Page Down</tt> key moves the cursor 10 seconds
backward or forward.  The <tt>Left</tt> or <tt>Right</tt> key moves the
cursor 1 second backward or forward.
The selection keys move the start or finish marker a tenth of second (0.1).
Using
<b>View | 1 Second</b> displays 1 second of audio.  At that level, the page,
arrow, and selection keys move 1 second, one tenth of a second,
and one hundredth of a second respectively.

<p>The <tt>Shift+Up</tt> and <tt>Shift+Down</tt> keys zoom in and out by 75%.
The status bars display the selection range and the current zoom level.

<p>Use <a href="#Options Window">Window</a> options to
change the default initial zoom level when a file is opened.


<a name="File Menu Commands"></a>
<h2>File Menu Commands</h2>
<p>This section explains commands under the GoldWave's
File menu.  The
<a href="#File Overview">File Overview</a> section provides
general information about how GoldWave handles files.

</p>
<a name="New"></a>
<h3>New</h3>

<p>Use New to create a new sound with attributes you specify.  These attributes
are discussed in
<a href="#Appendix: An Introduction to Digital Audio">Appendix A</a>.
Note that GoldWave allows you to create
and edit sounds that may not be playable with your audio hardware.
For CD quality, use stereo, with a sampling rate of 44100Hz.
Several commonly used settings are provided in the
<a href="#Presets">Presets</a>
list.  Use the <tt>Initial file length</tt> box to specify the time length of
the file.  You can alter the length later with
<a href="#trim">Edit&nbsp;|&nbsp;Trim</a>
or <a href="#Insert Silence">Edit&nbsp;|&nbsp;Inserting&nbsp;Silence</a>.

<p>To change the default save format shown in the status bar, see
<a href="#Options File Formats">File Formats</a>.  To change the
recording <a href="#Bits">bit depth</a>,
see <a href="#Device Properties">Device Properties</a>
</p>


<a name="Open"></a>
<h3>Open</h3>

<p>The Open command presents a list of files in your sound folder.  The
sound folder can be set using the
<a href="#Options Storage">Options&nbsp;|&nbsp;Storage</a>
command.  All recognized file
types are listed.  After you select a file, a
<a href="#Interface Sound Windows">Sound window</a>
is opened and details about the sound are displayed in the
status bar.  See the <a href="#File Format">File Format</a> section above
if GoldWave could not open the file.

<p>The <a href="#Storage Overview">Storage Overview</a> section explains how
the files are stored for editing.  Depending on the size of the file, you
may want to change the
storage setting under <a href="#Options Storage">Options&nbsp;|&nbsp;Storage</a>.

</p>
<a name="Close"></a>
<h3>Close</h3>

<p>Use Close to close the current sound.  If any changes
were made, you are asked to save them.

</p>
<h3><a name="Close All">Close All</a></h3>
<p>Use Close All to close all sound windows.  If any changes
were made to any of the sounds, you are asked to save each one.

</p>
<a name="Information"></a>
<h3>Information</h3>

<p>This command assigns or changes text information stored in the file,
such as artist, title, copyright, and date.
Information is stored in certain file types only, such as
<tt>.wav</tt>, <tt>.wma</tt>, <tt>.aiff</tt>, <tt>.ogg</tt>
and <tt>.mp3</tt>.  Some file types only store a subset
of all the items given in the File Information window.  There is no
verification of the information entered.  It is up to you how to
use these items and to follow any guidelines required for a
particular file type.

<p class="warn">
<img class="warn" src="warn.png" alt="Warning">
Any additional information or metadata within a file not shown in this window
is not preserved by GoldWave.</p>

<p>Use the Copy and Paste buttons to copy information from one file and paste
it into another.

</p>
<a name="Save"></a>
<h3>Save</h3>

<p>The sound is saved in a file using its original name and type.  If memory or
disk space is low, the file may not be saved successfully.  GoldWave will
inform you if this happens.  If Save fails, try deleting some unneeded files
or close other applications.  Make sure that the file is saved successfully
before closing GoldWave, otherwise the changes will be lost.  Note that
audio from video and movie files cannot be saved.  You must save those files
in an "audio only" format.  You will see the <a href="#Save As">Save As</a>
window if you need to save the file in a different type.

<p class="warn"><img class="warn" src="warn.png" alt="Warning">
Cue points are saved only in certain file types.  If you added
cue points to a file that does not support them, you can use
<a href="#Save As">File&nbsp;|&nbsp;Save As</a> to save it in
a different type or save them in a separate
<a href="#Cue File">Cue File</a>.
</p>

<p>An option to confirm saving is given under
the <a href="#Options Window">Options | Window</a> command.

</p>
<a name="Save As"></a>
<h3>Save As</h3>

<p>Save As saves a sound using a different filename or file type.  To save the
sound using a different name, simply type in the new name in the <tt>File name</tt>
box.  To save the sound using a different type, select the type from the "Save
as type" list box, then select attributes from the <tt>Attributes</tt> list box.
If a file type supports customized attributes, then the <tt>Attributes</tt>
label will become a link you can choose to display a configuration window.

<p>Since each file type supports different attributes, always select the type
before selecting attributes.  Java and Web sounds, for example, should be saved
using the "Sun (*.au)" type and the "Java/Web" attributes.

<p>You can use Save As to compress a sound as
well.  Select the "Ogg (*.ogg)" type and one of the many Vorbis attributes.
The smaller the <a href="#Bitrate">bitrate</a> (kbps number), the
smaller the file will be.  Note that quality may be reduced as well.

<p>Use <a href="#Options File Formats">Options&nbsp;|&nbsp;File&nbsp;Formats</a>
to assign a default format if you always prefer to use a specific file
type and attributes.

<p class="note">
<img class="note" src="note.png" alt="Note">
Unless the number of channels or sampling rate has changed, GoldWave does not
use the compressed audio data after saving.  It continues
to use the original audio stored in temporary storage.  You must close
and reopen the file in GoldWave (or play it in a separate program)
to hear how the compressed audio sounds.  It is strongly recommended that
you listen to the compressed file before discarding the original to
ensure its quality is acceptable.
</p>

<p class="warn"><img class="warn" src="warn.png" alt="Warning">
The correct type must be selected from the type box.
Typing in a different extension by hand for the filename does
not convert the sound to the type associated with that extension.
</p>


<h3><a name="Save All">Save All</a></h3>
<p>Saves all modified sounds.  Since saving all sound can take some time, you
are asked for confirmation before all sounds are saved.
</p>

<a name="Save Selection As"></a>
<h3>Save Selection As</h3>

<p>Save Selection As saves the selected part of
the sound to a file.  Use this command to save parts of a large file.
The <a href="#Save As">Save As</a> window appears where you can
specify the new filename, type, and attributes for the file.

</p>
<a name="Batch Processing"></a>
<h3>Batch Processing</h3>

<p>Batch Processing converts a set of files from one
format to another and applies effects.
Use this feature to compress all your
<tt>.wav</tt> files to <tt>.mp3</tt>
to save disk space or convert from <tt>.mp3</tt> to
<tt>.wav</tt> to prepare for writing to a CD-R audio disc.
You can remove pops/clicks, equalize, and maximize volume levels of all your
vinyl album or tape recordings.  Or you can add copyright and other text
information to all your own files.

<p> Add files with the Add Files button or drag-and-drop
a group of files from
Windows Explorer.  Add an entire folder (including subfolders) or all the
files in
a folder of a specific type by using the Add Folder button.  Remove items from
the list by selecting one or more of them and choosing the Remove button.
The Remove All button removes all files and folders from the list.

<p>The tabbed pages along the bottom let you configure conversions, effects,
destination folder, and file information.  These are explained below.

<p>When everything is configured, you can use the <a href="#Presets">preset</a>
controls to save all the settings, then choose the Begin button to start
processing all the files.  A status
window will appear showing the progress and listing any errors that
occur.

<p>Use the Apply button to start processing directly on the current
sound already opened in GoldWave.  Only the items listed on the
Process tab will be applied to the sound.  The sound is not converted
and file information is not changed.  This button is enabled only when
a sound is opened, there are items in the process list, and no files have been
added to the file list.


<p class="note">
<img class="note" src="note.png" alt="Note">
If you are trying to convert raw files, such as <tt>.vox</tt>,
you'll need to use
<a href="#Options File Formats">Options&nbsp;|&nbsp;File&nbsp;Formats</a>
to assign a format for that type first.
<p>

<div class="in">
<b>Convert Tab</b><br>
If you check the "Convert files to this format" box, then files
are converted to the format specified on this tab.  Otherwise
no conversion is performed and a processed file will have the
same format as the original file, if possible.  If the same format
cannot be used, then an error is reported.

<p>
Use the "Save as type" drop down list to select the destination format
for the conversion, then use the <tt>Attributes</tt> drop down list to select
the specific attributes to use for the destination type.  If a save
type supports customized attributes, then the <tt>Attributes</tt> label
will become a link you can choose to display a configuration window.

<p>
If the attributes allow any sampling rate to be used, you can specify
the destination rate to use by checking the <tt>Rate</tt> box
and entering the rate in the box.  Some attributes have a fixed rate, so a
separate rate cannot be specified for those.  If no rate conversion is
needed, make sure the <tt>Rate</tt> box is not checked.  In that case, a
processed file will have the same rate as the original file.

<p>
<b>Process Tab</b><br>
If you want to apply effects or edits to a group of files, use this tab
to add a set of effects, edits, or chains to the list.  If no effect
processing is required, remove all effects by using the Remove All
button on this tab.  To remove a single effect from the list, select
the effect and use the Remove button.  To change the order of processing,
drag-and-drop items within the list.

<p>
To add an effect, use the Add Effect button.  It presents
a tree list of all effects available and their presets.  Select
the preset you want to use.  Chains can be added by using
the Add Chain button.  Effects and chains are performed on the entire
file by default.  To perform them on part of the file only,
add an edit to set the selection first (see the fade in/out example
below).

<p>To add an edit, use the Add Edit button.  The "Set Marker/Selection"
edit command specifies what part of the file
(the <a href="#Editing Overview">selection</a>)
will be use for all subsequent effects and edits during processing.

<p>To change settings for an edit or
effect, remove it, add a new one with the correct settings,
then drag-and-drop it to the correct position in the process
list (if necessary).  If you require effect settings that are not
available in any of the current presets, open a file and use the
<a href="#Effect Menu Commands">Effect</a> menu or the
<a href="#Tool Effect Chain Editor">Effect Chain Editor</a>
tool to create a new preset or
chain with the settings you require prior to using the Batch
Processing command.

<div class="in">

<p><b>Process Example</b><br>
You have hundreds of songs and want to create a 10 second sample
file for each song, with the beginning faded in, the end faded out,
and the volume maximized.  To set up that processing requires adding
eight edits and effects, as explained below.

<ul>
  <li>Trim the file to 10 seconds:
  <ol>
	<li> Choose the Add Edit button.
	<li> Select the "Set Marker/Selection" edit command.
	<li> In the "Finish marker position" group, set the <tt>Time</tt> to
			10 and choose the <tt>From beginning</tt> radio button.
	<li> Choose the Add button.
	<li> Select the "Trim" edit command.
	<li> Choose the Add button.
	<li> Choose the Close button.
  </ol>

  <li>Fade-in the beginning of the file:
  <ol>
	<li> Choose the Add Edit button.
	<li> Select the "Set Marker/Selection" edit command.
	<li> In the "Finish marker position" group, set the <tt>Time</tt> to
			1 and choose the <tt>From beginning</tt> radio button.
	<li> Choose the Add button.
	<li> Choose the Close button.
	<li> Choose the Add Effect button.
	<li> Expand the "Fade In" branch.
	<li> Select the "Silence to full volume, linear" item.
	<li> Choose the Add button.
	<li> Choose the Close button.
  </ol>

  <li>Fade-out the end of the file:
  <ol>
	<li> Choose the Add Edit button.
	<li> Select the "Set Marker/Selection" edit command.
	<li> In the "Start marker position" group, set the <tt>Time</tt> to
			1 and choose the <tt>From end</tt> radio button.
	<li> Choose the Add button.
	<li> Choose the Close button.
	<li> Choose the Add Effect button.
	<li> Expand the "Fade Out" branch.
	<li> Select the "Full volume to silence, linear" item.
	<li> Choose the Add button.
	<li> Choose the Close button.
  </ol>

  <li>Maximize the volume of the entire file:
  <ol>
	<li> Choose the Add Edit button.
	<li> Select the "Set Marker/Selection" edit command.  Settings select
		 the entire file by default.
	<li> Choose the Add button.
	<li> Choose the Close button.
	<li> Choose the Add Effect button.
	<li> Expand the "Maximize Volume" branch.
	<li> Select the "Full dynamic range" item.
	<li> Choose the Add button.
	<li> Choose the Close button.
  </ol>
</ul>

After performing all these steps, the process list will contain eight edit
and effect items.  Use the Convert and Folder tabs to set the file type
and destination folder for the 10 second sample files (so the original
files are not overwritten).  Add all the songs to the Files list and
begin processing.
</div>

<p>To use clipboard related edit commands, it may be necessary to
open a file and copy it prior to using Batch Processing.  For example,
to paste or mix an announcement at the beginning of many files, first
open the file containing the announcement, use the
<a href="#Copy">Edit | Copy</a> command, then use the Batch Processing
command and add a "Paste" or "Mix" edit command to the Process list.

<p>
<b>Folder Tab</b><br>
If you want all processed files to be stored in the same folder
where they currently reside, select "Store all files in their
original folder".

<p>
If you want all processed files to be stored in a specific folder,
select "Store all files in this folder" and specify a
folder in the box provided.  You can click on the folder button
to browse for a folder.

<p>
When adding an entire folder with subfolders by using the Add Folder button,
use the "Preserve subfolder structure" box to ensure that the
relative subfolders are maintained when storing processed files in a different
destination folder.  If this box is not checked, all files will be stored
in the destination folder and no subfolders will be created.  Folders listed
in the file list will have double backslashes.  The part before the double
backslashes will be replaced by the destination folder.  For example, if
the destination folder is <tt>C:\Folder1\</tt> and the added folder
(with subfolders included) is <tt>C:\Source1\Source2\</tt>, then the file
list may look something like this:
<pre style="margin-left=40px">
C:\Source1\Source2\*.*
C:\Source1\Source2\\Source3\*.*
C:\Source1\Source2\\Source4\*.*
C:\Source1\Source2\\Source4\Source5\*.*
</pre>

<p>Note the double backslashes.  The destination folders will be:
<pre style="margin-left=40px">
C:\Folder1\*.*
C:\Folder1\Source3\*.*
C:\Folder1\Source4\*.*
C:\Folder1\Source4\Source5\*.*
</pre>

<p>Taking the last item, the folder is divided into three parts with the following colour coding: the
<tt style="background-color:#FFC0C0">original source root folders</tt>, the <tt style="background-color:#C0C0FF">subfolders</tt>, and the <tt style="background-color:#E0E0E0">pattern</tt>.
<br>
<tt style="background-color:#FFC0C0;margin-left=40px">C:\Source1\Source2</tt><tt style="background-color:#FFFFA0">\\</tt><tt style="background-color:#C0C0FF">Source4\Source5\</tt><tt style="background-color:#E0E0E0">*.*</tt>
<br>The destination folder is:<br>
<tt style="background-color:#C0FFC0;margin-left=40px">C:\Folder1\</tt>
<br>The original source folders are replaced by the destination folder to give:<br>
<tt style="background-color:#C0FFC0;margin-left=40px">C:\Folder1\</tt><tt style="background-color:#C0C0FF">Source4\Source5\</tt><tt style="background-color:#E0E0E0">*.*</tt>

<p class="warn">
<img class="warn" src="warn.png" alt="Warning">
Using the Add Folder button more than once when
preserving subfolders is not recommended unless you fully understand how
the source folder, subfolders, and destination folder are manipulated.
</p>

<p>
To overwrite any files having the same name and folder as the
processed file, check the "Overwrite existing files" box.  GoldWave
fully processes original files before overwriting them.

<p>
<b>Information Tab</b><br>
Use this tab to control how information is processed.  See
<a href="#Information">File&nbsp;|&nbsp;Information</a>.  Select
"Retain information currently
in each file" if you do not want the file's information to be
changed. Select "Replace information in all files" and use the
<tt>Set Info</tt> button to provide all the information.
Any blank entries are removed from the file.
Select "Replace specified information only in all files" to
replace some of the information.  Use the <tt>Set Info</tt> button
to enter the information
to replace.  Any blank entries are not removed or changed in the file.

<p class="note">
<img class="note" src="note.png" alt="Note">
If the <tt>Track number</tt>
is set to <tt>##</tt>, GoldWave replaces it with a sequential number based
on the order in which the files are processed.  The first processed file
will have a track number of 01, then the next file will have 02, etc.
</p>

<p class="warn">
<img class="warn" src="warn.png" alt="Warning">
Depeding on the settings used, all processed files may have exactly
the same information (except for <tt>##</tt> track numbering mentioned above),
so care must be taken when specifying file specific information such
as <tt>Title</tt>. Also note that not all file types can store information.
</p>

<p class="warn">
<img class="warn" src="warn.png" alt="Warning">
When retaining information and converting to a different file type, some information
from the old file type may not be valid for the new file type.  GoldWave does not verify
any information, so care must be taken when retaining information while converting.
</p>

<p>
<h4><a name="Batch Command Line">Command Line</a></h4>
The <tt>/process</tt> command line parameter starts GoldWave
in Batch Processing mode and processes files given on the
<a href="#Command Line Parameters">command line</a>.

The syntax is as follows:
<pre>
	"C:\Program File\GoldWave\GoldWave.exe" /process[:preset] &lt;filespec&gt; [&lt;filespec&gt; ...]
</pre>

If no preset is specified, then the default (previous) settings are used.
The <tt>filespec</tt> can specify a single file or contain wildcard characters
(* and ?).
Quotes are required if the <tt>filespec</tt> contains any spaces.

<p>To convert all Wave files to MP3 on the command line, for example, you'd
first use the Batch Processing command to create a
<a href="#Presets">preset</a>
with conversion
set to the "MPEG Audio" file type and save that preset as "MP3".  On the
command line, enter the following parameters:
<pre>
	/process:MP3 "C:\My Music\*.wav"
</pre>

<p>If the preset name contains spaces, use quotes around the entire parameter:
<pre>
	"/process:Trim and convert" "C:\My Music\*.wav"
</pre>

During processing the progress windows is displayed in minimized form, usually
just above the Windows Start button.  Double-click on it to open it to
monitor processing.
If no errors occur, the window will disappear and GoldWave will close
automatically.  Otherwise the progress window opens so that errors
can be viewed.  To use a log file instead, so that GoldWave always closes
regardless of errors, use the <tt>/proclog</tt> command line parameter to
specify the name of the log file:
<pre>
	/proclog:&lt;filename&gt;
</pre>
Quotes are needed around the entire parameter if the filename contains
spaces.  An example would be:
<pre>
	"/proclog:C:\Log Files\Batch.log"
</pre>

All messages and errors are written to the log file.  If you do not require
a log file, but still need GoldWave to always close, use <tt>nul</tt> as
the filename:
<pre>
	/proclog:nul
</pre>

</div>

<a name="Exit"></a>
<h3>Exit</h3>

<p>Exit closes all Sound windows then closes GoldWave.  Any playback or
recording is stopped.  You are asked to save any changed files.

</p>
<a name="File History"></a>
<h3>File History</h3>

<p>A list of several recently used files is appended to the File menu.  You can
quickly reopen one of these files by selecting it from the menu.

</p>
<a name="Edit Menu Commands"></a>
<h2>Edit Menu Commands</h2>

<p>Edit commands remove, insert, copy, and move sections of sound.  For an
introduction to the concepts and terms used in this section, refer to the
<a href="#Editing Overview">Editing Overview</a> section.

</p>
<a name="Undo"></a>
<h3>Undo</h3>

<p>The Undo command reverses the most recent change made to a sound.
The undo feature keeps a copy of the original data in a temporary file.
The temporary folder and the number of undo levels are determined by the
<a href="#Options Storage">Options&nbsp;|&nbsp;Storage</a> settings.
To disable Undo, set the number of undo levels to zero.

</p>
<a name="Redo"></a>
<h3>Redo</h3>

<p>The Redo command reverses the most recent undo.  It restores the
the last undone command without any processing.  The is helpful if you
accidentally undo a change (such as a recording) and want to recover
the change or if you want to do a quick "before and after" comparison.
Redo is possible only immediately after undo.  If you make any other changes
to the sound, Redo cannot be used again until you Undo one or more of
those changes.  Many levels of Undo and Redo are possible.  In other words,
you can undo several changes and redo them all.

</p>
<a name="Cut"></a>
<h3>Cut</h3>

<p>Use Cut to remove the selection from the sound and put it in the clipboard.
The contents of the clipboard can then be superimposed or inserted into a
Sound window using <a href="#Mix">Mix</a>
or <a href="#Paste">Paste</a>.  If you just want to remove the selection
and do not need to paste or mix it, you should use the
<a href="#Delete">Delete</a> command instead.

<p>Note that if only one channel is selected in a stereo sound, then only that
channel is removed.  Since it is not possible for one channel to be longer
than the other, the end of the cut channel is padded with silence (this is also
true for <a href="#Delete">Delete</a>).

<p>To cut:

<ol>
  <li> <a href="#Editing Overview">Select</a> the part of the sound you want
to cut.</li>
  <li> Choose <b>Cut</b> from the <b>Edit</b> menu.</li>
</ol>

<a name="Copy"></a>
<h3>Copy</h3>

<p>The Copy command copies the selection into the clipboard.  The selection
is not removed from the sound.  The contents of the clipboard can then be
mixed or placed into another sound using
<a href="#Mix">Mix</a>, <a href="#Paste">Paste</a>,
<a href="#Paste New">Paste New</a>
or <a href="#Replace">Replace</a>.

<p>To copy:

<ol>

<a name="Copy To"></a>
<h3>Copy To</h3>

<p>The Copy To command copies the selection to a new file.  Use this
command to divide a large file into smaller sections or save a
piece of a file. The selection is not
removed from the sound.  The <a href="#Save As">Save As</a>
window appears where you can
specify the filename, type, and attributes for the file.  This is the same
as the <a href="#Save Selection As">File&nbsp;|&nbsp;Save Selection As</a>
command.  To automatically split a large file into several smaller
pieces, use the <a href="#Tool Cue Points">Cue Points</a> tool.

<p>To copy the selection to the file "section.wav":

<ol>
  <li> <a href="#Editing Overview">Select</a> the part of the sound you want
to copy.</li>
  <li> Choose <b>Copy To</b> from the <b>Edit</b> menu.</li>
  <li> Enter the filename: <b>section</b></li>
  <li> Select "Wave (*.wav)" from the type list.</li>
  <li> Choose <b>Save</b>.</li>

<p class="note"><img class="note" src="note.png" alt="Note">
You can save individual channels of a stereo sound by using the
<a href="#Channel">Edit&nbsp;|&nbsp;Channel</a> menu.
</p>

<a name="Paste New"></a>
<h3>Paste New</h3>

<p>The Paste New command creates a new Sound window containing the sound copied into
the clipboard.  The new sound will have the attributes and length of the
clipboard sound.  This command is useful when you need to alter or save
the clipboard audio.

<p>To paste part of a sound into a new sound:

<ol>
  <li> <a href="#Editing Overview">Select</a> the part of the sound you want
to copy.</li>
  <li> Choose <b>Copy</b> from the <b>Edit</b> menu.</li>
  <li> Choose <b>Paste New</b> from the <b>Edit</b> menu.</li>
</ol>

<a name="Paste"></a>
<a name="Paste and Paste At"></a>
<h3>Paste and Paste At</h3>

<p>After copying a sound into the clipboard, you can use these commands to
insert it into another sound.  The Paste command inserts the clipboard
at the start marker's
position.  Paste At inserts the clipboard at the location you specify:
at the beginning of the file, at the finish marker, or at the end of the file.
The length of the sound is increased so that the clipboard will fit.  The clipboard
is automatically converted to match the attributes of the sound.

<p>To insert the clipboard into the sound:

<ol>
  <li> <a href="#Editing Overview">Move</a> the start marker to the place
where you want to paste the clipboard sound.</li>
  <li> Choose <b>Paste</b> from the <b>Edit</b> menu.</li>
</ol>

<p>To append the clipboard to the end of the sound:

<ol>
  <li> Choose <b>Paste At</b> from the <b>Edit</b> menu.</li>
  <li> Choose <b>End</b> from the <b>Paste At</b> submenu.</li>
</ol>

<p class="note"><img class="note" src="note.png" alt="Note">
Copying a small selection and pasting it several times creates a stutter

<a name="Mix"></a>
<h3>Mix</h3>

<p>Use Mix to blend (combine) the clipboard with the sound.
Note that before you can use Mix, you need to use
the <a href="#Copy">Copy</a> command to copy audio into the clipboard.
Mixing
essentially allows two sounds to be played at the same time, such as vocals
and music or voiceovers.  You are prompted for the mix volume applied to the clipboard and
the start time.  A volume of 0dB is full volume.  Lower values make the
clipboard sound quieter.  Adjust the start time to synchronize the clipboard
audio with the Sound window audio you are mixing with.

<p>To mix the clipboard with the sound:

<ol>
  <li> <a href="#Editing Overview">Move</a> the start marker to the place where you want to start mixing the
clipboard.</li>
  <li> Choose <b>Mix</b> from the <b>Edit</b> menu.</li>
  <li> Enter the mix volume for the clipboard.</li>
  <li> Adjust the start time as required.</li>
  <li> Choose OK.</li>
</ol>

<a name="Crossfade"></a>
<h3>Crossfade</h3>

<p>Use Crossfade to fade and mix the ends of two sounds, such as fading out
one song while fading in another.  Note that before you can use Crossfade, you
need to use the <a href="#Copy">Edit | Copy</a> command to copy the
entire song into the clipboard.  See the <a href="#Crossfading">Crossfading</a>
overview for step-by-step instructions.

<p>The <tt>Duration</tt> specifies how long the transition between the
clipboard audio and file audio lasts.  The <tt>Clipboard position</tt>
setting specifies which end of the file to fade the clipboard audio.
If <tt>End of file</tt> is selected, then the clipboard is pasted and
crossfaded at the end of the file.  If <tt>Beginning of file</tt> is
selected, then the clipboard is pasted and crossfaded at the beginning
of the file.  The <tt>Fade curve</tt> settings control how
the audio is faded.  If the song being faded out already has a fade out
at the end, use the <tt>None</tt> fade out curve setting.
The fade is shown graphically and can be previewed.  Note that any changes
made while previewing will not take effect until preview is restarted.

<p class="note"><img class="note" src="note.png" alt="Note">
The <a href="#Editing Overview">selection</a> is used when
performing a crossfade.  Use the
<a href="#Select All">Edit&nbsp;|&nbsp;Select&nbsp;All</a> command before
using Crossfade unless you intend to crossfade within a certain
part of the sound.</p>

<a name="Replace"></a>
<h3>Replace</h3>

<p>Use Replace to replace the selection with the clipboard.  The selection is
deleted and the clipboard is inserted in its place.  If the clipboard is longer
or shorter than the selection, the length of the file is adjusted as required.
To avoid changing the length of the file or altering the timing of the
sound following the selection, use <a href="#Overwrite">Overwrite</a> instead.

<p>To replace part of a sound with the clipboard:

<ol>
  <li> <a href="#Editing Overview">Select</a> the part of the sound you want
to replace.</li>
  <li> Choose <b>Replace</b> from the <b>Edit</b> menu.</li>
</ol>

<a name="Overwrite"></a>
<h3>Overwrite</h3>

<p>Use Overwrite to overwrite part of the sound with the clipboard beginning
at the start marker's position.  The
amount of sound overwritten depends on the length of the clipboard.  The
length of the file is not changed (unless the clipboard would go beyond
the length of the file) and no shifting is performed.
Note that if the clipboard is longer than the current selection, then
some sound outside the selection will be overwritten as well.  The finish
marker will be placed at the end of the overwritten sound.

<p>Use Overwrite instead of <a href="#Replace">Replace</a> when you need to
preserve tempo, timing, or alignment of the sound following the
selection.

<p>To overwrite part of a sound with the clipboard:

<ol>
  <li> <a href="#Editing Overview">Move</a> the start marker to the beginning
of the sound you want to overwrite.</li>
  <li> Choose <b>Overwrite</b> from the <b>Edit</b> menu.</li>
</ol>

<a name="Delete"></a>
<h3>Delete</h3>

<p>The Delete command removes the selection from the sound.
The selection is not copied
to the clipboard.  You should always use Delete instead
of <a href="#Cut">Cut</a> when the
selection is not needed.  The Delete command is faster because it
does not copy the selection to the clipboard.

<p>Note that if only one channel is selected in a stereo sound, then only that
channel is removed.  Since it is not possible for one channel to be longer
than the other, the end of the deleted channel is padded with silence (this is
also true for <a href="#Cut">Cut</a>).

<p>To delete:

<ol>
  <li> <a href="#Editing Overview">Select</a> the part of the sound you want
to delete.</li>
  <li> Choose <b>Delete</b> from the <b>Edit</b> menu.</li>
</ol>

<a name="Trim"></a>
<h3>Trim</h3>

<p>The Trim command removes everything <em>outside</em> the selection.  The selection is not
affected.  Use this command to keep part of a sound and discard
everything else.  This command is frequently used after recording to
trim any leading or trailing silence.  Note that
if only one channel of a stereo sound is trimmed, the end of that channel
is padded with silence.  As an alternative, you can use the
<a href="#Copy To">Copy To</a>
command to save the selection to a separate file or use the
<a href="#AutoTrim">AutoTrim</a> command to automatically trim silences.

<p>To trim:

<ol>
  <li> <a href="#Editing Overview">Select</a> the part of the sound you want
to keep.</li>
  <li> Choose <b>Trim</b> from the <b>Edit</b> menu.</li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="AutoTrim">AutoTrim</a></h3>

<p>The AutoTrim command removes leading and trailing silences from the ends
of the selection.  Unlike the
<a href="#Trim">Trim</a> command, this command works only on the selection
and does not remove silences outside the selection.

<p><tt>Silence to keep</tt> controls how much silence to leave on the
ends.  Use zero to remove all silence.  Extra silence is <b>not</b> added if
the existing silence is less than this amount.
The <tt>Threshold</tt> specifies the minimum level of audio that should not be
considered silence.
If the audio has a lot of background noise or hiss, use values above -30dB.
If the audio is clean, values below -40dB.

<p>Leading silence, trailing silence, or both will be removed depending on
the <tt>Trim</tt> option you select.

<p>Note that
if only the left or right channel is selected in a stereo sound, then only
that channel is trimmed.  Since it is not possible for one channel to be
longer than the other, the end of the trimmed channel is padded with silence,
which results in trailing silence.

<p>To trim silences from the ends of the entire file:
<ol>
  <li>Select the entire file by using the
	<a href="#Select All">Edit&nbsp;|&nbsp;Select All</a> command.
  <li>Choose <b>AutoTrim</b> from the <b>Edit</b> menu.
  <li>Enter the length of silence to keep and the threshold for the
	the silence.
  <li>Choose OK.
</ol>


<a name="Mute"></a>
<h3>Mute</h3>

<p>The Mute command replaces the selection with silence.  Unlike
<a href="#Delete">Delete</a> or <a href="#Cut">Cut</a>, the
length of the sound is not changed.  Use this to remove
offensive language from music without interrupting the overall beat.

</p>
<a name="Insert Silence"></a>
<h3>Insert Silence</h3>

<p>The Insert Silence command inserts some blank
space in the sound at the start marker's
position.  Use
this command to make room for recording or to insert a delay.
You are prompted to 
<a href="#Interface Entering Times">specify the duration</a>
of the silence.
</p>

<p>To insert 1 minute of silence:<br>
<ol>
 <li>Move the start marker to the place where you want to insert
	the silence.  See <a href="IntroEdit.html">Editing Overview</a>.
 <li>Choose <B>Insert Silence</B> from the <B>Edit</B> menu or click the <B>Silen</B> button.
 <li>Enter <b>1:00</b> for the duration.
 <li>Choose <B>OK</B>.
</ol>

<a name="Select View"></a>
<h3>Select View</h3>

<p>Use Select View to select all of the sound currently shown in the Sound
window's graph.  The start and finish markers are moved to the far left and
far right of the view.

</p>
<a name="Select All"></a>
<h3>Select All</h3>

<p>Use Select All to select the entire sound.  The start and finish markers are
moved to the beginning and end of the sound.

</p>
<a name="Channel"></a>
<h3>Channel</h3>

<p>The Channel submenu sets which channel of a stereo sound to use or
modify for editing or effects.  Use this feature to copy a single
channel from a stereo sound or apply an effect to only one channel.  The
currently selected channel is shown in the status bar.  When recording or
using effects such as
<a href="#Resample">Resample</a>,
<a href="#Playback Rate">Playback Rate</a>, or stereo
effects, the channel setting does not apply and both the
left and right channels are modified.
<p> You can right-click on the channel item in the status bar to quickly
select a channel or use
<a href="#Options Tool Bar">Options&nbsp;|&nbsp;Tool&nbsp;Bar</a> to
add a "Channel" toggle button to the tool bar.

</p>
<a name="Marker"></a>
<h3>Marker</h3>

<p>The Marker submenu lists commands for changing the positions of the start and
finish markers for adjusting the selection.

<div class="in">
<a name="Marker Set"></a>
<h4>Set</h4>

<p>	Sets the start and finish markers to an exact time or sample position.
To specify a time, choose the <tt>Time</tt> option and
<a href="#Interface Entering Times">enter the time</a> in
hours, minutes, seconds, and thousandths of a second.  For
example,  you could enter 1:04:27.873.  To specify a sample
position, choose the <tt>Sample</tt> option and enter the position.

<p>	If you want the length of the selection to be aligned to a CD sector
or 1 kilobyte, select the appropriate option.  When the OK button
is pressed, the finish marker is adjusted to align the selection
length.
</p>

<a name="Marker Previous"></a>
<h4>Previous</h4>

<p> Moves the start and finish markers to their previous positions.  The last
five positions are stored automatically whenever the markers are moved.  Using
this command repeatedly sets the selection back to each of those five positions.
Note that
<i>absolute positions</i> are stored, so any modifications, such as
deleting part of the sound will not be factored into the previous positions.
In such situations the previous positions may not select the same part of the
sound that was previously selected (that part may be deleted).
</p>

<a name="Marker Drop Start/Finish"></a>
<h4>Drop Start/Finish</h4>

<p>	When playing or recording a file, you can drop the start or finish marker at the
current position.  You can use the bracket keys, <b>[</b> and <b>]</b> to
drop the start and finish markers respectively.
Note that the start marker cannot be dropped after the finish marker.

</p>
<a name="Marker Recall Selection Positions"></a>
<h4>Recall Selection Positions</h4>

<p>	Moves the start and finish markers to previously stored positions.  These
positions are set using the
<a href="#Marker Store Selection Positions">Store Selection Positions</a>
command.    Hold the Ctrl key to recall the positions stored within a
different Sound window.

</p>
<a name="Marker Store Selection Positions"></a>
<h4>Store Selection Positions</h4>

<p>	Saves the current positions of the start and finish markers.  Use the
<a href="#Marker Recall Selection Positions">Recall Selection Positions</a> command
to move the markers back to these positions.
Hold the Ctrl key to store the positions so they can be recalled in a different
Sound window.

</p>
<a name="Marker Snap To Zero-Crossing"></a>
<h4>Snap To Zero-Crossing</h4>

<p>	When editing, it is important that the waveform not change
suddenly from one amplitude to the next, otherwise a click will occur.
This can happen when deleting the selection.  The amplitude of the
waveform at the start marker may be completely different from the
amplitude at finish marker.  After deleting the selection, these two
different amplitude will be right next to each other, causing a click.

<p>	The "Snap To Zero-Crossing" feature helps to minimize the problem
by making sure that the markers are always near zero amplitude
samples.  When you drag and release a marker, it is automatically
moved to a position where the amplitude approaches zero.  This
means that when you delete the selection, the amplitudes at both the
start and finish markers will be more closely matched (near zero).

<p>	Since stereo sounds can have very different left and right channels,
it is not always possible to find an ideal zero-crossing position.
However, you can use the <a href="#Channel">Edit&nbsp;|&nbsp;Channel</a>
menu to limit the snap feature to a single channel.

<p> Note that if you zoom in close enough so that the true shape of the waveform
is shown (such as <a href="#Zoom 1:1">View&nbsp;|&nbsp;Zoom 1:1</a>),
the snap feature is automatically turned off so that
markers can be placed at any position.

</p>
<a name="Drop Cue"></a>
<h4>Drop Cue</h4>
<p>Drops a cue point at the current playback, recording, or start marker
position.  The name of the cue point is set to the time position by default, but
that can be changed by the <a href="#Auto Cue Button">Auto Cue</a>
settings under the Cue Points tool.

</p>
<a name="Jump To Next Cue"></a>
<h4>Jump To Next Cue</h4>
<p>Moves the start marker to the next cue point or to the end of the file.

</p>

<a name="Jump To Previous Cue"></a>
<h4>Jump To Previous Cue</h4>
<p>Moves the start marker to the previous cue point or to the beginning of
the file.
</p>

<a name="Split File"></a>
<h4>Split File</h4>
<p>Divides the file into smaller sections using cue points at split points.
See <a href="#Split File Button">Split File Button</a> under the
<a href="#Tool Cue Points">Cue Points</a> tool for more information.
</p>

<h4><a name="Show Cue Lines">Show Cue Lines</a></h4>
<p>Displays vertical cue lines on the
<a href="#Interface Sound Windows">Sound window</a> graph.  This setting
applies to each Sound window individually, so lines can be shown in one
window and not in another.  When a new window is opened, the last setting
selected is used.

<a name="Effect Menu Commands"></a>
<h2>Effect Menu Commands</h2>
<p>This section explains commands under the GoldWave's
Effect menu.  Please see the
<a href="#Effects Overview">Effects Overview</a> section for
general information about how GoldWave employs effects.

</p>
<a name="Doppler"></a>
<h3>Doppler</h3>

<p>A Doppler effect is defined as a change in frequency of a wave caused by
motion.  You often hear it when police or ambulance sirens
drop in pitch as they pass near by.

<p>In GoldWave the Doppler effect dynamically alters or bends the pitch
of the selection.  It does this by altering the speed at which the waveform
is played.  Note that both pitch and tempo are changed.

<a href="#Shape Controls">Shape Controls</a>
are presented where the pitch/speed can be varied
over the selection from 0.25 to 2.0 times normal.  You can use
<a href="#Shape Volume">Effects&nbsp;|&nbsp;Volume&nbsp;|&nbsp;Shape&nbsp;Volume</a>
to dynamically alter the volume as well.

<p>The "Slow down" preset gives you a good idea of what it sounds like when
the batteries start to fail in a portable tape player.  Other presets can change
your voice to a smurf ("Faster") or a giant ("Slower").

</p>
<a name="Dynamics"></a>
<h3>Dynamics</h3>

<p>Dynamics alters the <a href="#Volume Scales">amplitude</a>
mapping of the selection.  It can limit,
compress, or expand a range of amplitudes.  The amplitude mapping is set
using <a href="#Shape Controls">Shape Controls</a>, where x-axis
and y-axis both have a range of -1 to 1.
When the line stretches diagonally from the lower left corner to the upper
right corner, the input amplitude (x) and output amplitude (y) are the same
for every point on the line.  By changing the line, the output will differ from
the input.

<a name="Figure Dynamics"></a>
<p><center><img src="dynamics.png" width="191" height="186" alt="Dynamics"><br>
Figure: Dynamics</center>

<p> The <a href="#Figure Dynamics">figure</a>
shows an example of amplitude mapping for clipping distortion.
Point <b>P<sub>1</sub></b> has an input value of -0.4 and an output value of -0.4.  Therefore
no change occurs to the amplitude.  Point <b>P<sub>2</sub></b> on the other hand, has an input
value of 0.8 and an output value of 0.5.  In this example, all input
amplitudes in the range of -0.5 to 0.5 remain unchanged.  Any values
outside this range will be limited to &#177;0.5, so that the final sound will have
no amplitude magnitudes greater than 0.5.  Essentially, any values that are
too high are "clipped" to fit within the range.

<p>In practical terms, dynamics can increase the volume of quiet sections of a
sound without greatly increasing the loud sections as well.  It can introduce
mild or heavy distortion effects (such as the "Blare" or "Hiss noise"
<a href="#Presets">preset</a>).

<p><b>See Also</b>
<br><a href="#Compressor/Expander">Compressor/Expander</a>

</p>
<a name="Echo"></a>
<h3>Echo</h3>

<p>Echo produces an echo or reverb effect in the selection.  The parameters
include number of echoes, echo delay, echo volume, feedback, stereo, and
tail generation.

<p><tt>Echoes</tt> specifies the number of times the sound is repeated
and mixed at a diminished volume with the given delay.

<p> The <tt>Delay</tt> is the amount of
time it takes for the first echo to be heard.  If more than one echo is
used, then each subsequent echo delay is compounded by this amount again.
In other words, the second echo is delayed twice as long, the third
echo is delayed three times as long, and so on.

<p> The <a href="#Volume Scales">Volume</a>
controls how loud the first echo is.  The volume of subsequent echoes is
compounded in the same way the delay is.

<p><tt>Feedback</tt> makes the echo sound deeper and richer.  It
regenerates each echo, and the echo of those echoes, and
so on, creating many more echoes than before.

<p>The <tt>Stereo</tt> option makes the echo bounce between the left and right
channel of a stereo sound.

<p>The <tt>Generate tail</tt> option adds some silence
to the end of the selection so that the trailing, fading echoes can be
stored.  This increases the length of the sound.  Turn this setting off
if you do not want to change the length of the selection or have any
silence inserted.  If the option is off, echoes will end abruptly rather
than trailing off gradually.

<a name="Compressor/Expander"></a>
<h3>Compressor/Expander</h3>

<p>The Compressor/Expander effect dynamically alters the audio volume
level.  It is commonly used as a compressor, limiter, expander, or gate.

<p class="note">
<img class="note" src="note.png" alt="Note">
This effect does not change the size of the file.  For
<a href="#File Compression">file compression</a>,
use <a href="#Save As">File&nbsp;|&nbsp;Save As</a> and
change the type and attributes.
</p>

<p>Compressors and limiters are used to decrease or limit the dynamic
range of audio.  In plain English, they reduce the volume of loud
sounds while leaving the rest of the sound unchanged.
Expanders and gates are used to increase the dynamic range of audio.
They reduce or eliminate quiet sections while leaving louder sections
unchanged, which can help to reduce background noise.

<p>Compressors always work on loud sections and expanders
always work on quiet sections.  Normally, both compressors and
expanders only reduce the volume.  However, GoldWave also allows
you to boost the volume.

<p>The <tt>Multiplier</tt> specifies the
amount of <a href="#Volume Scales">volume</a>
change.  It is the scale factor applied to the sound when
the threshold is met.
For compressors, it is the amount to scale the loud sections.  For
expanders, it is the amount to scale the quiet sections.
Normally a value less than 0dB should be used
to reduce the volume.

<p>The <tt>Threshold</tt> specifies the audio level to activate the
expander or compressor.  Compressors scale the volume level
of all sounds above that level.  Expanders scale the volume level
of all sounds below that level.

<p> The <tt>Attack</tt> and <tt>Release</tt> times specify how quickly the
expander/compressor is activated.  An attack value of 0.100 means
that the audio level will have to cross the threshold for at least
one tenth of a second before the multiplier is used at full strength.
A release value of 0.100 means the multiplier will continue to be
used for one tenth of a second after the audio level no longer crosses
the threshold.

<p>Use the <tt>Expander</tt> or <tt>Compressor</tt>
mode to specify what processing is required.

<p>The <tt>Anticipate attack</tt> setting tells the
effect to scan ahead for audio
that crosses the threshold.  If the <tt>Attack</tt> time is set to 0.100,
then the effect scans ahead by 0.100 seconds.  This means that the multiplier
will be at full force the instant the threshold is crossed rather
than building to full force 0.100 seconds later.  The <tt>Use smoother</tt>
setting smooths out any sudden volume changes which may occur during
processing with small attack/release times.

<div class="in">
<p><b>Compressor Example</b><br>
You have recorded some music that has a few loud moments, but you want
to raise the overall volume without distorting the loud
parts.  Select the "Reduce loud parts" <a href="#Presets">preset</a>.
After compression, use the
<a href="#Maximize Volume">Maximize Volume</a>
effect to stretch the volume to the full dynamic range.
Alternatively you could use the "Boost quiet parts" preset.

<p><b>Expander Example</b><br>
You have recorded someone talking and notice background noise
during the quiet parts.  To reduce the noise, select the
"Noise gate" preset or the "Reduce quite parts" preset.

<a name="Filter"></a>
<h3>Filter</h3>

<p>Filters are used to remove a range of frequencies from a sound and can
produce a variety of effects.  The submenu contains several filter
related effects.

<div class="in">
<a name="Bandpass/stop"></a>
<h4>Bandpass/stop</h4>

<p>	Bandpass filters block all <a href="#Frequency Ranges">frequencies</a>
outside a specified range,
keeping only frequencies within the range.  Bandstop filters block all
frequencies within a specified range, keeping all other frequencies
outside the range.

<div class="in">
<p><b><a href="#Frequency Ranges">Frequency Range</a></b><br>
The <tt>From</tt> and <tt>To</tt> boxes
specify the initial frequency range of the
filter.  If the Dynamic option is selected, then a final
frequency range can be given in the other <tt>From</tt> and <tt>To</tt>
boxes, allowing you to fade from on frequency range to another.
Otherwise the initial range remains constant for all processing.

<p><b>Settings</b><br>
Select Bandpass if you want to keep only the frequencies
within the range.  Select Bandstop if you want to block
all the frequencies in the range.
The remaining Static, Dynamic, and Steepness options are explained under
<a href="#Low/Highpass">Low/Highpass</a> filter.

<p><b>Example</b><br>
To remove hum and hiss from a voice recording:
<ol>
	<li> Set <tt>From</tt> to 200.
	<li> Set <tt>To</tt> to 3800.
	<li> Choose the <tt>Bandpass</tt> option.
	<li> Choose the <tt>Static</tt> option.
	<li> Set <tt>Steepness</tt> to 10 or higher.
	<li> Choose OK.
</ol>
</div>

<a name="Equalizer"></a>
<h4>Equalizer</h4>

<p>	Equalizers are commonly found on stereo systems.  They boost or
reduces certain
<a href="#Frequency Ranges">ranges of frequencies</a>.  Simple
equalizers control only treble and bass.  GoldWave's equalizer controls 7
bands, as shown in the figure.

<p><center><img src="equalizer.png" width="376" height="337" alt="Equalizer"><br>
Figure: Equalizer</center>

<p>Center frequencies for each of the 7-bands are given at the top of
each fader.  Adjust the faders to boost or reduce a band by
+12dB to -24dB.

<p>	To change bass, adjust the two or three left-most bands.  To change
treble, adjust the two or three right-most bands.  Several
<a href="#Presets">presets</a> are
included to demonstrate bass, mid, and treble changes.

<p>	More detailed equalization is possible using the
<a href="#Parametric EQ">Parametric EQ</a>, described below.

<h4>Low/Highpass</h4>

<p>	Lowpass filters block high pitched,
<a href="#Frequency Ranges">frequencies</a> (treble)
but allow
low pitched frequencies (bass) to pass.  They can be used to reduce
high end hiss noise or remove unwanted sounds above the given
cutoff frequency.  If you were to apply a lowpass filter with a cutoff
frequency of 1000Hz on speech, it would make it sound mumbled
and deep.  Lowpass filters can also be used to eliminate aliasing
noise when used before downsampling.

<p>	Highpass filters block low pitch frequencies, but allow high pitched
frequencies to pass.  They can remove deep rumbling hum or
remove unwanted sounds below the given cutoff frequency.  If you
were to apply a highpass filter with a cutoff frequency of 1000Hz
on speech, it would make it sound thin and hollow.

<div class="in">
<p><b><a href="#Frequency Ranges">Cutoff Frequency</a></b><br>
The <tt>Initial cutoff</tt> specifies the constant cutoff frequency for
static filtering.  If the <tt>Dynamic</tt> option is selected (see
below), then a final cutoff frequency can be given in the
<tt>Final cutoff</tt> box, allowing you to fade from one cutoff to another.

<p><b>Filter Options</b><br>
Select <tt>Lowpass</tt> if you want to keep only the frequencies
below the cutoff frequency.  Select <tt>Highpass</tt> if you want
to keep only the frequencies above the cutoff frequency.

<p>If you want the cutoff frequency to remain constant
throughout the selection during processing, select the
<tt>Static</tt> option.  If you want the cutoff frequency to change
from the initial value to the final value, select the <tt>Dynamic</tt>
option.  Note that dynamic filtering will take more
processing time.

<p>The <tt>Steepness</tt> value specifies how sharply the filter cuts
off frequencies outside the cutoff frequency.  A higher
steepness makes the filter sharper, but it also increases
processing time.  In technical terms, the steepness specifies
the number of second order cascade filters used.

<p><b>Examples</b><br>
To make speech gradually become more hollow and thin:
<ol>
  <li> Set <tt>Initial cutoff</tt> to 60.</li>
  <li> Choose <tt>Dynamic</tt>.</li>
  <li> Set <tt>Final cutoff</tt> to 1000.</li>
  <li> Choose <tt>Highpass</tt>.</li>
  <li> Choose OK.</li>

<a name="Noise Reduction"></a>
<h4>Noise Reduction</h4>

<p>	Noise Reduction uses frequency analysis techniques to remove
unwanted noise, such as a background hiss, a power
hum, or any continuous, consistent sound.  It cannot be used to separate or
remove complex or brief sounds, such as coughs, laughter and applause.
It cannot remove instruments or vocals from music.

<p>	The interface, shown in the figure below, includes a frequency
analysis window, with <a href="#Shape Controls">Shape</a> and
other controls.  The x coordinate is the frequency in Hertz and the y
coordinate is the magnitude in <a href="#Volume Scales">decibels</a>.

<p><center><img src="noisereduction.png" width="445" height="414" alt="Noise Reduction"><br>
Figure: Noise Reduction</center>

<p>The frequency analysis provides graphical information about all frequencies
within the sound at the given time.  For stereo sounds, the left channel
is shown in green and the right channel is shown in red.
The time of the frequency analysis within the sound is given in the
<tt>Time</tt> box.  Move the scroll bar located below the analysis window to
change the analysis time to show the frequency analysis of a different
part of the sound.  The detail of the analysis depends on the FFT
size setting, explained below.

<div class="in">
<p><b>Reduction Envelope</b><br>
Noise is removed using a reduction envelope.  The shape of the
envelope should closely match the shape of the noise you want to
remove.  The frequency analysis graph can help determine that
shape.  Change the analysis time so that it coincides with a time in
the sound where only the noise is heard (use the
<a href="#Preview">preview</a> button
to play the file to find such a place and time).  Once you have
isolated the noise in the analysis
graph, you can then create the envelope.  The envelope can be created
in four different ways, depending on the reduction envelope
setting.  The "Use clipboard" option generally gives the best results.
Also try the <a href="#Presets">presets</a>.

<div class="in">
<p><b>Use shape</b><br>
Lets you manually create an envelope shape or select a
preset shape.  See <a href="#Shape Controls">Shape Controls</a>
for information about creating shapes.  By creating a horizontal
line at about 80dB, you can remove a hiss from a sound.  In
some cases, you'll need to trace the outline of the graph
or draw completely different shapes to reduce the unwanted
frequencies levels.

<p><b>Use current spectrum</b><br>
Creates an envelope based on the shape of the graph shown
in the frequency analysis window.  This is particularly
useful for removing a complex buzz or hum.  It is important
that the analysis Time is set to a place where the noise is
heard by itself initially.

<p><b>Use average</b><br>
Applies an averaging envelope throughout noise reduction
processing.  The envelope is continuously updated, based
on the average frequency analysis of the sound. Use this setting if
the noise changes frequently throughout the sound.

<p><b>Use clipboard</b><br>
Creates an envelope based on an analysis of the waveform in the
clipboard.  This is the most flexible option and usually gives the
best results.  Before you can use this
option, you must use <a href="#Copy">Edit&nbsp;|&nbsp;Copy</a>
to copy a piece of noise
into the clipboard.  For best results, the piece should contain only
the noise you want to remove from the rest of the file.  The noise
can even be copied from a different file.  After you copy
the noise, remember to change the <a href="#Editing Overview">selection</a>
to the part of the file you want to apply the noise reduction.

</div>
<p><b>Settings</b><br>
The <tt>FFT size</tt> determines the detail of the frequency analysis and the
noise reduction envelope.  Usually values of 11 or higher give the
best results.  The <tt>Overlap</tt> value specifies the percentage of the FFT
size to overlap from one calculation to the next.  A value of 88 works
well.  The <tt>Scale</tt> value lets you alter the reduction envelope scale.
A value of 100 uses the envelope as it is.  A value of 200 doubles
the envelope, which doubles the amount audio removed from the
sound.  A value of 50 halves the envelope, which halves the amount
removed.  Normally it should be set to 100.
</div>


<a name="Parametric EQ"></a>
<h4>Parametric EQ</h4>

<p>	A parametric equalizer (shown below) is a flexible tool for reducing or
enhancing ranges of <a href="#Frequency Ranges">frequencies</a>.
GoldWave presents an easy to use
interface where all the parameters for up to 40 bands can be
configured quickly.  The <a href="#Presets">presets</a> contain some
commonly used templates.

<p><center><img src="parametriceq.png" width="473" height="447" alt="Parametric Equalizer"><br>
Figure: Parametric Equalizer</center>

<div class="in">
<p><b>Graph window</b><br>
The graph shows frequency on the x-axis in Hertz and the
gain on the y-axis in decibels.  Each enabled band is
displayed in the graph as a diamond shaped box located at
its center frequency and gain.  The width of the box shows
the bandwidth.  The currently selected band is shown in
blue and its exact settings are given in edit box controls.

<p>A short time frequency analysis graph is drawn with the
left channel in green and the right channel in red.  The time
of the analysis can be changed using the scroll bar located
at the bottom of the graph.  The analysis helps
determine what frequencies to boost or reduce.  A high pitched
squeal, for example, would appear as a spike near the right
side of the graph.  Whereas a low pitched hum would be a spike
or bump near the left side.
</div>

<div class="in">
<p><b>Controls</b><br>
A band is configured by selecting its number from the
Band box and adjusting the Gain, Width, and Center faders.  A quicker
method is to <i>drag-and-drop</i> the band to a new location on the
graph.  Note that because of the logarithmic frequency
scale, the width of a diamond changes as you move it left
or right.  The bandwidth, however, remains constant.

<p>Use the diamond plus button to add more bands.  Use the diamond
minus button remove existing bands.  The current (blue) band given
in the Band box is the one removed.
</div>

<p>The "Notch" <a href="#Presets">preset</a>
is effective for removing a simple tone from
a sound, such as a 60Hz hum or telephone dial tones.
The "Bass boost" and "Treble
boost" presets work the same way as the bass and treble controls on
a stereo system.  Adjust the gain up or down to control them.

</p>

<a name="Pop/Click"></a>
<h4>Pop/Click</h4>

<p>A pop/click filter is a specially designed filter that searches for
abrupt changes in the sound and eliminates them.  Such a filter is
often used to remove pops and clicks caused by dust and scratches
when recording old vinyl records.

<p>The <tt>Tolerance</tt> defines how abrupt a change can be before it
is considered a click.  It is best to start with a value near 1000%.
Using a lower value will detect more clicks, but may eliminate
natural clicks such as drum sticks tapping together or a conductor
tapping the baton.  Values less than 500% should be used on short
selections only.

<p>When a click is detected, the filter attempts to reconstruct the damaged
waveform based on the surrounding waveform shape making the repair almost
imperceptible.  However with excessive pops and clicks or at low tolerance
levels, reconstructed waveforms may overlap and sound distorted.  The
tolerance setting should be kept as high as possible.  Using a very low
setting may introduce more distortion than existed in the original.
This is most noticeable in voice recordings or instrument solos,
particularly trumpet solos.

<p>The filter requires a minimum <a href="#Editing Overview">selection</a>
of 4000 samples (about one tenth of
a second at CD quality) to establish a base line.  Using the filter on a
shorter selection has no effect.

</p>
<h4><a name="Silence Reduction">Silence Reduction</a></h4>

<p>This filter automatically removes silences from a sound.  Use it to save
storage space or to remove long pauses in speeches or police/airport
radio recordings.

<p>The <tt>Silence threshold</tt> specifies the <a href="#Volume Scales">volume</a>
level for the silence.  Any audio below this level is considered
silence and is subject to removal, provided it has a long enough duration.
The <tt>Duration</tt> specifies how long the silence must be before
it is reduced.  Any silences short than this remain unchanged.
</P>

<P><tt>Reduce to</tt> is a percentage that specifies the length of the reduced silence
relative to its original length.  A
value of 75, for example, reduces a 10 second silence to 7.5 seconds.
</P>

<P><tt>Maximum length</tt> specifies the maximum length for reduced
silences.  This setting overrides the <tt>Reduce to</tt> setting if the
reduced length still exceeds the maximum.  If this is set to 5 seconds in
the above example, then the 10 second silence is reduced to 5 seconds.
</P>

<a name="Smoother"></a>
<h4>Smoother</h4>

<p> Use this filter to reduce hiss and crackle.

<tt>Length</tt> sets the length of the smoother filter.  The larger the value, the
more averaging is applied to the audio and the duller it will sound.
Use the <tt>Volume</tt> setting to help offset the loss in volume for larger
Length values.

<h4><a name="Spectrum Filter">Spectrum Filter</a></h4>

<P>A spectrum filter is a general purpose audio filter similar to
a <a name="Parametric EQ">parametric equalizer</a>, but
with much greater control.  Instead of using
individual bands, the entire frequency spectrum is controlled using
a shape line that controls the <a href="#Volume Scales">gain</a>.
This allows many kinds of filters
to be designed, such as lowpass, highpass, bandpass, bandstop, notch,
peak, comb, and more.  Filtering is performed in the frequency domain using
Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs).

<P>A spectral analysis window is displayed with a shape
line and several other controls.  The <tt>X</tt> and <tt>Y</tt> coordinates
are updated when you click-and-drag a shape point.  The <tt>X</tt>
coordinate is the frequency in Hertz and the <tt>Y</tt> coordinate
is the magnitude in decibels.  The time of the spectral analysis
shown is given in the <tt>Time</tt> box.  If you move the time scroll bar,
located below the analysis window, the graph changes to show the spectral
analysis of a different part of the sound.  The <tt>Master gain</tt> controls
the overall <a href="#Volume Scales">gain</a> of the filter, which is equivalent
to shifting the entire shape up or down.</P>

<P>Initially the shape line is horizantal at 0dB, which means that no changes
in gain are made at any frequency.  Alter the shape line up or down to increase
or decrease the gain at a particular frequency.  In technical terms, the
shape line represents the frequency response function.

<P><B>Settings</B><br>
The <tt>FFT size</tt>
determines the detail of the spectral analysis and the resolution of the filter.
Higher settings provide a higher resolution, allowing the filter to follow
the shape more accurately, with sharper cutoffs.  When processing high sampling
rate files, such as 88kHz or 192kHz, the <tt>FFT size</tt> must be set higher
for the filter to follow the shape.  Using too high a value may cause overshoot
and oscillations in the gain.
The <tt>Overlap</tt> value specifies
the percentage of the FFT size to overlap from one
calculation to the next.  The lowest value gives the fastest processing and
generally works well.</P>

</div>


<a name="Flanger"></a>
<h3>Flanger</h3>

<p>A flanger effect is similar to an echo effect in that the original sound is
mixed with a delayed copy of itself.  Unlike an echo, where the delay is
constant, a flanger varies the delay over a given range.  The
speed, or <em>frequency</em>, at which the delay varies is controlled as well.
The Flanger effect presents a window where you can set the depth,
frequency, and fixed delay parameters and control how the sound is
mixed.  Many <a href="#Presets">presets</a> are included to
demonstrate the kinds of unusual audio effects that are possible.

<div class="in">
<p><b><a href="#Volume Scales">Volumes</a></b><br>
The <tt>Source</tt> volume
specifies the volume of the original sound to mix
with the final sound.  A value of 0 means the original sound will
not be mixed at all with the final sound.  If this value is set to 100 and all
other volumes are 0, no change is made to the sound.  A value
of -100 inverts the source, which is equivalent to subtracting
the original instead of adding it to the final sound.

<p>	The <tt>Flanger</tt> volume specifies the volume of the delayed
sound to mix with the final sound.  Usually, this value should be in
the range of 25 to 100, or -25 to -100 for an inverted mix.

<p>	<tt>Feedback</tt> specifies the level of feedback (previously generated
output) to mix with the final
sound.  This makes the effect more full and pronounced.  Set this
value to 0 if you do not want any feedback.  In general the feedback
should be set to between -75 to 75.

<p><b>Flanger Settings</b><br>
<tt>Variable delay</tt> specifies the maximum variable delay in milliseconds.  A
value of 40 will allow the delay to vary from 0 to 40 milliseconds.

<p>	<tt>Frequency</tt> specifies how fast to vary the delay.  A value of 2 will
vary the delay over from 0 to its maximum twice a second.  For a value of
0.2, the maximum delay is reached every five seconds.

<p>	The <tt>Fixed delay</tt> is added to the depth to change the minimum
delay.  If the variable delay is 40 and the fixed delay is 10, the delay will
vary from 10 to 50 milliseconds.

<p> The <tt>Sine modulator</tt> and <tt>Triangular modulator</tt> settings
control how the delay is varied.  If sine is selected, then the delay
varies on a sinusoidal pattern.  If triangular is selected, then the
delay varies in a simple linear pattern.

<p> The <tt>Stereo</tt> option allows the flanger and feedback audio to be
bounced between the left and right channels of a stereo sound, giving
a more pronounced stereo effect.
</div>

<a name="Interpolate"></a>
<h3>Interpolate</h3>

<p>Interpolate (see figure below) uses linear interpolation to smooth
out the waveform within the selection.  Use this command on a tiny selection
to remove a pop or click.  This command should not be used on a large
selection.

<p><center><img src="interpolate.png" width="344" height="140" alt="Interpolate"><br>
Figure: Interpolate</center>
<p></p>

<a name="Invert"></a>
<h3>Invert</h3>

<p>Invert reflects the selection about the time (horizontal) axis.
The selection is essentially
turned upside-down.  This produces no noticeable effect in mono sounds
and has a slight effect in stereo sounds.  Inverting a single channel of a
stereo sound produces an "in" or "out" effect.

<p>Inverting can be used before mixing so that the two sounds are subtracted
instead of added.
</p>

<a name="Mechanize"></a>
<h3>Mechanize</h3>

<p>Mechanize gives a robotic or mechanical characteristic to a
sound through a method known as amplitude modulation.  This effect
was widely used in old science fiction movies.  The
rate of modulation is controlled with the <tt>Frequency</tt> value.  The
sound is modulated with one of several waveforms given in the table.
<p>

<tr>
<td valign="top">Sine
</td>
<td valign="top">
The sound is modulated with a sinusoid, which tends to shift the

</center>

<a name="Offset"></a>
<h3>Offset</h3>

<p>The Offset effect adjusts or removes a dc offset in the
selection by shifting it up or
down so that the wave is centered on the horizontal axis.

<p><center><img src="offset.png" width="357" height="142" alt="Offset"><br>
Figure: Offset</center>

<p>Positive values shift the graph up and a negative
values shift it down.  Use the Scan Offset button to automatically
determine what offset to use to remove any existing offset.  After
scanning completes, the <tt>Left</tt> and <tt>Right</tt> values are
set such that
they will cancel out the offset in the given channel.  If the values
are zero, then no offset was detected.

<p>Any offset should be removed to minimize pops/clicks during
editing.  Offsets may interfere with other effects as well.

<p class="note">
<img class="note" src="note.png" alt="Note">
You should check the offset from time to time after processing
effects.  Otherwise, the offset may increase with each effect,
resulting in some distortion.
</p>

<a name="Pitch"></a>
<h3>Pitch</h3>

<p>Pitch changes the pitch (frequency) of the selection.  This is useful for
converting instrument samples from one note to another.  The new pitch is
specified using a scale factor or using semitone and fine tune values.

<div class="in">
<p>	<b>Scale</b><br>
This option scales the pitch by a percentage value.  If you set the
scale to 50, that is equivalent to a downward shift by one
octave.  A value of 200 is the same as an upward shift of one octave
and would make a voice sound like a chipmunk.  A value of 75
would make a woman's voice sound like a man's.

<p><b>Semitone</b><br>
This option changes the pitch by semitones (notes on a piano).  If
your sound is a note at middle C and the semitone value is 2, the
note is changed to D.  A value of -1 changes the note to B.  A
value of 12 make the note one octave above middle C.  The Fine
tune value lets you make a slight pitch adjustment in hundredths of
a semitone.  For example, a value of 50 changes a note from C to
halfway between C and C#.

<p><b>Preserve length</b><br>
If this option is checked, a complex algorithm is used to keep
the length of the original note the same as the new note.  In other
words, the tempo will not be changed.  In terms of a voice
recording, this changes the pitch of the voice without changing the
speed at which the words are spoken.  This option requires a
substantial amount of processing time and will affect the quality of
the sound.

<p>	The <tt>FFT size</tt> determines how much of the sound to process at one
time, based on a power of 2.  A value of 10, for example means
that 1024 (2<sup>10</sup>) samples are processed at a time.  Values from 11
and up give good results.  The <tt>Overlap</tt> determines what percentage
of the processed samples are recalculated.  It should be at least
88.  Values of 90 and 95 will give better results, but require more
processing time.
</div>

<a name="Effect Plug-in"></a>
<h3>Plug-in</h3>

<p>This menu lists all <a href="#Effect Plug-ins">plug-ins</a> detected by
GoldWave.  If any compatible
DirectX plug-ins are detected, then they are listed under a
DirectX submenu.
</p>

<a name="Reverse"></a>
<h3>Reverse</h3>

<p>This command reverses the selection so that it plays backward.  Now you
have an easy way to capture all those "satanic verses" or reverse speech
messages.  You can play a sound backwards by using the
<a href="#Rewinding and Fast Forwarding">rewind</a>
button on
the Control window as well.

</p>

<a name="Reverb"></a>
<h3>Reverb</h3>

<p>Reverb adds body and richness to the sound by simulating the
acoustic reverberation and echoes within a chamber or room.

<p>The <tt>Reverb time</tt> sets the size of the reverb.
A longer time simulates a larger chamber or room.

<p>The <tt>Volume</tt> controls how loud the reverb is.  Values
less than -18dB give good results.

<p>The <tt>Delay scale</tt> alters the delay of the reverb for fine tuning.
Use 1.0 for a standard reverb.

</p>

<a name="Stereo"></a>
<h3>Stereo</h3>

<p>The Stereo submenu contains commands that apply to stereo files, such as
swapping channels and left/right panning.

<div class="in">
<a name="Channel Mixer"></a>
<h4>Channel Mixer</h4>

<p>	This command swaps, mixes, inverts, or combines the left and right channels
in a variety of ways.  The left and right channels are replaced with
a mixed combination of both channels, depending on the volume levels
set.  Use the controls in the <tt>Left channel</tt> box
to set the mixing volume percentages for the left channel.  Use
the controls in the <tt>Right channel</tt> box
to set the mixing volume percentages for the right channel.

<p>	To swap the left and right channels:
<ol>
  <li> In the <tt>Left channel</tt> box, set the <tt>Left volume</tt> fader
		to 0 and the <tt>Right volume</tt> fader to 100.
  <li> In the <tt>Right channel</tt> box, set the <tt>Left volume</tt> fader
		to 100 and the <tt>Right volume</tt> fader to 0.
  <li> Choose OK.</li>
</ol>

<a name="MaxMatch"></a>
<h4>MaxMatch</h4>

<p> This command automatically balances the left and right
channels and maximizes the volume levels.  Essentially, this
effect uses the <a href="#Match Volume">Match Volume</a> effect
internally on the left and right channels, then uses the
<a href="#Maximize Volume">Maximize Volume</a> effect.

<p>After processing, the left and right channels will have the same
average <a href="#Volume Scales">volume</a>
level and at least one channel will have full
dynamic range (1.0 or 0dB).  Note that it is rarely possible for
channels to have the same average and both have full dynamic range
at the same time.  Typically one channel will have a dynamic range
of slightly less than 1.0 or 0dB.

</p>
<a name="Pan"></a>
<h4>Pan</h4>

<p>	Pan presents the <a href="#Shape Controls">Shape Controls</a>
where left and right panning can
be controlled.  The graph is divided into green and red regions,
representing the left and right channels respectively.  The line,
initially located between the regions, represents the center for
panning.  By bending and/or moving the line, you can dynamically
alter the selection's left/right balance or pan to and from each
channel.  The figures below show several examples of panning
shapes.

<table cellpadding="20%" width="100%">

</td></tr></table>

<p>There are two end points on the pan shape line by default.
Use the <tt>Point</tt> box to select the point to edit.  The X and Y values control the location
of the selected point.  X is the time and Y is the amount of panning.  A positive Y value
pans to the left.  A negative value pans to the right.  For end points, only Y can be changed.
X is fixed at the beginning and ending of the selection.

<p><b>Example:</b> Select point 1 and set Y to -1.0 to make panning start at full right.
Select point 2 and set Y to 1.0 to make panning end at full left.  Panning will go from
right to left over the selection.

<p>Use the <tt>Add Point</tt> button to insert a new point between the two end points.
Note that the point numbers change, with point 3 as the end point and
point 2 as the new one.  Both the X and Y values can be changed for that point.
To make panning go slightly left at 10 seconds into the file, for example, set X to 10.0
and Y to a positive value, such as 0.25.  When adding points, be sure to select the point
after which you want to insert the new point.  The X value for each point is confined to
adjacent points.

<p>The <tt>Show balance</tt> option calculates and displays the current
peak balance in yellow on the graph.  For a typicaly stereo song, a
spiked line roughly centered around zero would appear.  For a 2 channel
mono file, it would be a perfectly flat line at zero.  For an unbalanced
file, the line would be above or below zero.


<p>The <tt>Change volume only</tt> setting
limits the pan effect to volume changes only.  Normally panning
mixes the left and right channels to alter the balance.  This setting
prevents any mixing and only changes the relative volumes of the channels.


<a name="Reduce Vocals"></a>
<h4>Reduce Vocals</h4>

<p>	This effect reduces vocals from certain stereo recording by
subtracting the left and right channels and by using a bandstop filter.  This
works best when vocals are recorded exactly the
same on the left and right channels and no stereo effects have
been applied to the vocals.  Note that
any instruments record the same in both channels are reduced as well.

<p>
Usually subtracting the left and right channels destroys the stereo sound,
giving mono output.  However, by integrating a bandstop filter, GoldWave
is able to restore some of the stereo, enhancing the output.

<p>Increase the bandstop filter <tt>Volume</tt> and bring the <tt>From</tt>
and <tt>To</tt> values
closer together for increased stereo (increases the vocals).  Decrease

<a name="Time Warp"></a>
<h3>Time Warp</h3>

<p>Time Warp changes the playback speed or alters the tempo of
the selection.  This effect has many uses: it can stretch or compress a sound
to fit in a certain time, it can slow down instrumental music for easy
transcription, or it can change the tempo of one musical passage to match
rhythm and beats of another.

The <tt>Change</tt> option lets you specify a relative change in percent.  A
value of 50 makes the selection play twice as slow. A value of 200 makes the
selection play twice as fast.  The <tt>Length</tt> option lets you specify a new length
for the selection. Use this to make a sound fit a certain
time, such as squeezing a 35 second commercial into a 30 second spot.

<p><center><img src="timewarp.png" width="413" height="403" alt="Time Warp"><br>
Figure: Time Warp</center>

<p>Three different time altering algorithms are provided, each with
certain advantages and disadvantages.

<div class="in">
<p>	<b>Speed</b><br>
The Speed algorithm simply changes the sampling rate of the entire
sound so that it plays
back at a different speed, similar to spinning a vinyl record faster
or slower.  It works the same way as the speed fader in the
Control window, but in this case, the sound itself is
changed.  This technique is very fast and produces excellent quality,
however, the pitch of the sound is changed as well.  In other words,
if you were to speed up a voice, the pitch becomes higher, making
the voice sound like a chipmunk.

<p><b>Similarity</b><br>
The Similarity algorithm uses correlation to add and overlap small, similar
sections of the sound.  This technique preserves the pitch.  It
generally produces high quality voice and fair quality music when
using small speed or time changes.  A fair amount of time may be
require for processing, depending on the Search range value.  For
voice, the Window size should be set between 20 and 30 and the
Search range set to between 5 and 10.  For music, a larger Window
size and Search range gives better results, such as 60 and 25.

<p><b>FFT</b><br>
The FFT algorithm uses Fourier transforms and interpolates or decimates the
frequency analysis to change the length.  This technique preserves
the pitch, but can introduce some artifacts into the sound.  Best
quality is obtained by using the Oscillator synthesis option, but that
requires significant processing time.  The <tt>FFT size</tt> should be set
from 11 to 12 and the <tt>Overlap</tt> should be at least 75, but can be set
to 88, 90, or 95 for better quality.  The <tt>FFT size</tt> and <tt>Overlap</tt>
settings are explained under the <a href="#Noise Reduction">Noise Reduction</a>
filter section.
</div>

<p class="note">
<img class="note" src="note.png" alt="Note">
If you changed the speed fader in the Control window, remember to
set it back to 1.00 so that the device plays at the correct speed.
</p>

<a name="Volume"></a>
<h3>Volume</h3>

<p>The Volume submenu contains several volume related commands.  Volumes
are usually specified in decibels (dB) or by a percentage (%) of the sound's
original amplitude.  For more information about volumes, see
<a href="#Volume Scales">Volume Scales</a> in
<a href="#Appendix: An Introduction to Digital Audio">Appendix A</a>.
Unlike the volume fader in the <a href="#Control Overview">Control</a>
window, which changes the device playback volume, these commands scale
the sound's data to change the volume.

<div class="in">
<a name="Change Volume"></a>
<h4>Change Volume</h4>

<p>	This command modifies the selection so that it sounds louder or
quieter.  You need to enter the new relative volume.  Values less
than 0dB make the selection quieter.  Values greater than 0dB make
it louder.  A value of 0dB leaves the volume unchanged.

<p> If you are trying to make the volumes of several different songs
sound the same, use
<a href="#Match Volume">Effect&nbsp;|&nbsp;Volume&nbsp;|&nbsp;Match&nbsp;Volume</a> instead.

</p>
<a name="Fade In"></a>
<h4>Fade In</h4>

<p>	Fade In gradually increases the volume throughout the selection.
You need to specify the initial volume.  Normally to fade in
from complete silence, you'd use the lowest possible value of &minus;160dB.

<p>The Logarithmic and Linear options control the shape of the fade.
A Logarithmic fade will fade in more rapidly than
a Linear fade.

<p>	To fade in the first 5 seconds of a sound from silence:
<ol>
  <li> <a href="#Editing Overview">Select</a> the first 5 seconds
of the sound.</li>
  <li> Choose <b>Fade In</b> from the <b>Effect&nbsp;|&nbsp;Volume</b> submenu.</li>
  <li> Enter &minus;160 for the <tt>Initial volume</tt>.</li>
  <li> Choose OK.</li>
</ol>

<a name="Fade Out"></a>
<h4>Fade Out</h4>

<p>	Fade Out gradually decreases the volume throughout the selection.
You need to specify the final volume.  A value of &minus;160dB
fades to complete silence.

<p>The Logarithmic and Linear options control the shape of the fade.
A Logarithmic fade will fade out more rapidly than
a Linear fade.

<p>	To completely fade out the last 5 seconds of a sound:
<ol>
  <li> <a href="#Editing Overview">Select</a> the last 5 seconds of
the sound.</li>
  <li> Choose <b>Fade Out</b> from the <b>Effect&nbsp;|&nbsp;Volume</b> submenu.</li>
  <li> Enter &minus;160 for the <tt>Final volume</tt>.</li>
  <li> Choose OK.</li>
</ol>

<a name="Match Volume"></a>
<h4>Match Volume</h4>

<p>The Match Volume effect makes the volumes of separate files seem similar.
When creating a CD, you often find that each songs is recorded
at a different volume level.  This means you have to adjust
the CD Player volume from one song to the next.  By using the Match Volume
effect, you can adjust the volume levels of each song so they
all have the same average level, eliminating the need to adjust
the volume for each song later.

<p>Volume changes are based on a root-mean-square (rms) average.  The
rms average is calculated with silent
regions (below -44dB) excluded. Files with similar average levels will
seem to have similar overall volume levels.

<p>Use this effect on each file to set the <tt>Average</tt> to the same value.
Use the <a href="#Batch Processing">File&nbsp;|&nbsp;Batch&nbsp;Processing</a>
command to apply this effect to a group of files before burning them
to a CD.  The <tt>Clipping control</tt> options are explained in the table
below.

<p class="note">
<img class="note" src="note.png" alt="Note">
If you want to
match the left and right channel levels of a single file, use the
<a href="#MaxMatch">Effect&nbsp;|&nbsp;Stereo&nbsp;|&nbsp;MaxMatch</a>
effect instead.
</p>

<p> The average value to use depends on the files.  You should open each file
and display the Match Volume effect to see what average value it has, then apply
an overall average value to all the files.  To avoid clipping distortion, it
is best to use the minimum average across all files.  For example, if one
file has an average of -20dB and all the other files have a higher average,
such as -18dB, then use -20dB for all files.

<p>Unlike the <a href="#Maximize Volume">Maximize Volume</a>
volume effect, the Match Volume effect may result in
<a href="#Clipping">clipping</a>
distortion if the average level is set too high.  The <tt>Final peak</tt>
area displays the resulting final peak level after processing.  If the
peak exceeds 0dB, the value is shown in red as a warning that clipping
may occur.  Use a lower average to avoid clipping.

<p>This effect should not be
used with <a href="#Maximize Volume">Maximize Volume</a>.
Use one or the other, but not both (one cancels the other).

<p><center>Table: Clipping Control</center>
<center>
<table border cellpadding=5 width="75%">
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="50%"><b>Option</b></td>
<td valign="top" width="50%"><b>Purpose</b>
</td></tr>

<tr>
<td valign="top">Allow clipping
</td>
<td valign="top">
Uses the given average level, regardless if clipping is required.
</td></tr>

<tr>
<td valign="top">Reduce average level to avoid clipping
</td>
<td valign="top">
Reduces the average level just before processing begins to ensure
that the audio will not be clipped.  A lower level is used for the entire
file, so the file may not sound as loud as other files processed with
the same level where clipping was not required.
</td></tr>

<tr>
<td valign="top">Abort processing if clipping is required
</td>
<td valign="top">
Processing is aborted immediately when clipping is required.  A
range error is displayed.  Use this setting for batch processing to
prevent writing clipped audio.
</td></tr>

</table>
</center>



</p>
<a name="Maximize Volume"></a>
<h4>Maximize Volume (Normalize)</h4>

<p>	Maximize Volume searches the selection for the current peak volume
level.  It then displays the level and the position of the level within the
file.  You can then specify a
new absolute maximum volume level.  The volume of the entire selection is
changed so that the maximum will match that value.  A
value of 0dB gives you full dynamic range.  This is often
referred to as "normalizing" the volume.

<p> Some effects in GoldWave may cause the volume level to go
above 0dB.  After using many effects, you should use the Maximize Volume
effect before saving a file to ensure that the full dynamic range is
not exceeded.  Otherwise <a href="#Clipping">clipping</a>
may result in the saved file.

<p class="note">
<img class="note" src="note.png" alt="Note">
Always use Maximize Volume before saving a file to avoid
<a href="#Clipping">clipping</a> and make full use of the dynamic
range.
</p>

<a name="#Shape Volume"></a>
<h4>Shape Volume</h4>

<p>Shape Volume presents <a href="#Shape Controls">Shape Controls</a>
where the volume envelope of
the selection can be defined.  The shape line is initially horizontal
at 1.0, representing normal volume.  By bending or moving the
line, you can dynamically change the volume over the selection.
Adding a point below 1.0 decreases the volume.  Adding a point
above 1.0, in the red section, increases the volume.  Note that
increasing the volume may cause <a href="#Clipping">clipping</a> distortion.
Several <a href="#Presets">preset</a> shapes are included.

<p>The <tt>Show envelope</tt> option calculates and displays the current
volume envelope of the sound.  The left channel envelope is shown
in green and the right channel envelope is shown in red.

<div class="in">
<p><b>Example</b><br>
To use this effect to reduce the volume of background music before
mixing in a voice recording or narration over the music:
<ol>
<li> Open the voice file and make note of its length.</li>
<li> Choose <b>Copy</b> from the <b>Edit</b>.
<li> Open the music recording.</li>
<li> Choose <b>Shape Volume</b> from the <b>Effect&nbsp;|&nbsp;Volume</b> submenu.</li>
<li> Select the "Fade for voice-over" preset.</li>
<li> Adjust the trough of the shape so that its time length is slightly
larger than the length of the voice file and its position is located
where you want to mix the voice file.</li>
<li> Choose OK.</li>
<li> Adjust the start marker to the position where you want to mix
the voice file (the beginning of the trough).</li>
<li> Choose <b>Mix</b> from the <b>Edit</b>.</li>
<li> Choose OK.</li>
</ol>
</div>

</div>

<a name="Playback Rate"></a>
<h3>Playback Rate</h3>

<p>The Playback Rate effect changes the playback rate of the
<em>entire</em> sound.  The sound
plays faster (or slower) and its pitch is higher (or lower), similar
to playing a vinyl record faster or slower.
Essentially, this just changes the sampling rate value
shown in the status bar.

<p class="note">
<img class="note" src="note.png" alt="Note">
While the playback rate of the audio device is controlled with the
speed fader in the Control window, this has no effect on the
file's data.  You must use the Playback Rate effect for the change
to be savable.
</p>

<a name="Resample"></a>
<h3>Resample</h3>

<p>The Resample effect changes the sampling rate of the <em>entire</em> sound.
Unlike <a href="#Playback Rate">Playback Rate</a>, this command
re-calculates and interpolates all the data so that the
pitch and playback time are not affected.  Use this command to
convert any sampling rate to the standard CD rate of 44100Hz or the
standard telephony rate of 8000Hz.

<p>Up-sampling and down-sampling filters are automatically
applied as required.

<p class="note">
<img class="note" src="note.png" alt="Note">
If you have a sound recorded at 44100Hz and do not need CD
quality, you can save large amounts of disk space by resampling the
sound to 22050Hz or 11025Hz.  This reduces the size by 2 to 1 or 4 to 1.
</p>

<a name="View Menu Commands"></a>
<h2>View Menu Commands</h2>

<p>Before reading this section, review the terms introduced in the
<a href="#Interface Overview">Interface Overview</a> and
<a href="#Editing Overview">Editing Overview</a> sections.

<p>View commands allow you to see a more detailed graph of part of the
sound.  They are similar to zoom commands in the Windows Paint
accessory.  When you zoom in (or magnify) the sound, you see a smaller
section, but with greater detail.  When zoomed out, you see the entire sound,
but with less detail.  The Overview box near the bottom of each Sound
window gives you some information about what section of the sound is
currently shown in the view (see the
<a href="#Figure Main Window">Main Window</a> figure).

<p>When zoomed in to a part of the sound, a scroll bar appears at the
bottom of the Sound window so you can move to different parts of the
sound while still keeping the same level of magnification.  The current level
of magnification is displayed in the Main window's
<a name="Figure Status Bar">status bar</a> next to the
modified status.  The magnification is given as two numbers separated by
a colon.  The first number is the number of pixels and the second number
is the number of <a href="#Sample">samples</a>
mapped to those pixels.  For example,
1:1 means one sample is mapped to one pixel and for 51:1003,
1003 samples are mapped to 51 pixels.

<p>Most view commands use the start marker's position as the starting location
for magnification, so you should move the start marker to the position of
interest first.

<p class="note">
<img class="note" src="note.png" alt="Note">
Use the <a href="#Options Window">Options&nbsp;|&nbsp;Window</a>
command to set the initial zoom level when a file is opened.
</p>

<a name="All"></a>
<h3>All</h3>

<p>The entire sound is graphed in the view.  In other words, it zooms all the
way out so that the entire sound is visible.  You can move the start and
finish markers to select any part of the sound.

</p>
<a name="Specify"></a>
<h3>Specify</h3>

<p>This magnifies the graph to any level you specify.
The level can be given as a time length or as a ratio.  If the Length
option is selected, then the length you specify is shown in the
graph.  For example, use 1:00 to show one minute of audio.
If the Ratio option is selected, then the given number of
<a href="#Sample">samples</a> are mapped to a single pixel on the
screen.  Values greater than 1 display an approximation of the
waveform.  Values less than 1 (such as 0.1) reveal individual
samples and allow
<a href="#Redrawing the Waveform with the Mouse">direct editing of the waveform</a>.

<p>The Start time specifies what position in the file to begin drawing the zoomed waveform.
If the given level is not possible, the closest valid level is used.

</p>
<a name="Selection"></a>
<h3>Selection</h3>

<p>The selection is magnified, increasing the detail of the graph.  You can
zoom in many times by changing the selection and magnifying it again until
only a single sample is shown in the view.

<p class="note">
<img class="note" src="note.png" alt="Note">

<a name="Preset"></a>
<h3>Preset</h3>

<p>A <b>Preset</b> button is provided in the tool bar so that you can quickly zoom to
your favourite level. The sound is magnified to the level of detail specified
under <a href="#Options Window">Options&nbsp;|&nbsp;Window</a>.
The level can be set to any value you find convenient.

</p>
<a name="Previous"></a>
<h3>Previous</h3>

<p>This returns the view to the previous zoom level.  Use this to switch
back and forward between two different zoom levels.

</p>
<h3><a name="Auto Scroll Lock">Auto Scroll Lock</a></h3>

<p>When this item is checked, the view scrolls automatically to follow playback
and recording.  Scrolling occurs only when zoomed in and when the current playback
or recording position goes outside the view.  This feature also enables
<a href="#Accessibility Navigation">keyboard navigation</a>, which allows the
playback cursor to be moved via the keyboard.
</p>

<a name="Zoom In"></a>
<h3>Zoom In</h3>

<p>Magnifies the sound by a factor of 1.33x.  This gives 33% more detail, but
shows 33% less sound.  The middle of the view is used as the zoom center.
This command complements Zoom Out.

<p class="note">
<img class="note" src="note.png" alt="Note">
Click-and-drag the right mouse button over the waveform to zoom in

<a name="Zoom Out"></a>
<h3>Zoom Out</h3>

<p>Reduces magnification by a factor of 1.33x.  This gives 33% less detail, but
shows 33% more sound.  The middle of the view is used as the zoom center.
This command complements Zoom in.

</p>
<a name="Zoom 10:1"></a>
<h3>Zoom 10:1</h3>

<p>When the number to the left of the colon is greater than the number
to the right, a very small
section of sound is magnified at a high level of detail.  At these levels,
individual samples are easily visible and
<a href="#Redrawing the Waveform with the Mouse">direct waveform editing</a>
with the mouse is possible.

</p>
<a name="Zoom 1:1"></a>
<h3>Zoom 1:1</h3>

<p>At a level of 1:1, each audio sample is represented as a single pixel on the

<a name="10 Seconds"></a>
<a name="Zoom 1 Second, 10 Seconds, 1 Minute, 1 Hour"></a>
<h3>Zoom 1 Second, 10 Seconds, 1 Minute, 1 Hour</h3>

<p>These show the given amount of time of audio beginning at the start marker's
position.  You can use
<a href="#Start and Finish">View&nbsp;|&nbsp;Finish</a>
to see the audio at the end.
</p>

<a name="Vertical Zoom All"></a>
<h3>Vertical Zoom All</h3>

<p>Vertically zooms all the way out so that the entire vertical amplitude range
of the sound is shown.

</p>
<a name="Vertical Zoom In"></a>
<h3>Vertical Zoom In</h3>

<p>Magnifies the graph vertically to show 1.33 times as much amplitude detail.
Zooming is centered on the horizontal center of the view.

</p>
<a name="Vertical Zoom Out"></a>
<h3>Vertical Zoom Out</h3>

<p>Reduces vertical magnification to show 1.33 times less amplitude detail.
This show a larger range of the amplitude.  Zooming is centered on the
horizontal center of the view.

</p>
<a name="Start and Finish"></a>
<h3>Start and Finish</h3>

<p>These commands scroll the view to either the start or finish marker's
position.  The view is centered over the marker's position provided its
position and the level of magnification permit it to be centered.  These
commands are especially useful when you need to move a marker to a
precise position.  For example, you can zoom in 1:1 and move the start
marker to an exact position and then use <b>View&nbsp;|&nbsp;Finish</b> to set the finish
marker's position.

</p>
<a name="Tool Menu Commands"></a>
<h2>Tool Menu Commands</h2>

<p>GoldWave includes several tools for working with audio files.  These are
described in the following sections.

</p>
<a name="Tool CD Reader"></a>
<h3>CD Reader</h3>

<p>	The CD Reader tool digitally copies audio directly from
an audio CD to a file on your hard drive, without using your sound
card.  This features has several advantages over normal recording:

<p>
<ul>
  <li> There is no need to create and initialize a new file.</li>
  <li> Audio can be compressed while extracting, saving of
hard drive space.</li>
  <li> Recording volume controls do not have to be selected or
adjusted.</li>
  <li> Synchronizing sound card recording with CD playback is not required.</li>
  <li> Many CD-ROM drives read audio several times
faster than sound card recording.</li>
  <li> Information such as artist, title, and album can be downloaded
and saved automatically.
</ul>

<p>	The CD-ROM drive must be MMC compliant (Multimedia Command Standard).
For Windows 95, 98, and ME you must have an ASPI driver installed.  For
Windows 2000, XP, or later, support is built-in.  Due to the wide
variety of interfaces and
inconsistent device standards, incompatibilities may arise that will
require a system reset.  It is recommended that you close all other
programs before proceeding.

<p>	If your system is configured correctly, the window
allows you to select a CD device and to specify tracks to copy.
If you have only one CD-ROM drive, only one device is
listed in the drop down list.  If you already have an audio CD in the
drive, the track times are shown in the lists.
Otherwise you will need to insert an audio CD and re-select the device
from the list.

<div class="in">
<p><b>Read Tracks Tab</b><br>
Use this tab to copy several tracks to separate files.
The Get Titles button downloads information (album, titles, etc.)
about the CD from an Internet database.  An active connection to the
Internet is required.  You can select a single track from the list and
use the Rename button (or Alt+R) to manually rename it.  Use the
Save Tracks button (the one with the diskette icon) to save all titles
and disc information to the hard drive.

<p>Use the Select All button to select all tracks or check the box
for each track you want to save.  You can preview tracks by selecting
the Read Time Range tab, described below.

<p>The Save button saves
all selected tracks to separate files using the track title as the
filename.  You can select the file format and other options on the Save CD
Tracks window that appears.

<p> Use the Options tab to configure settings before saving.

<p><b>Read Time Range Tab</b><br>
Use this tab to copy any time range from the CD or to preview parts
of the CD.  A fast CD-ROM or DVD drive is required for previewing.
You may have to increase the "Read speed" or the
"Number of sectors per read" setting under the Options tab
to get smooth playback.  See the Options tab settings below.

<p>The Save button saves the given time range to a single file.  You
can select the file format and provide a filename in the standard
Save As window that appears.

<p><b>Options Tab</b><br>
Use the Options tab to changes settings for reading audio from the
CD and the Internet database server.

<p><b>Troubleshooting</b>
<ul>
<li>If you get synchronization errors at the beginning, try continuing
several times before giving up.  Some drives are very inaccurate when
spinning up and may require many continues before synchronization
can be reliably established.  If that does not help, set the
"Number of sectors to overlap" value to zero on the Options tab and try again.</li>
<li>If you see an error message indicating a read problem, make sure that the
CD is free of dust and finger prints.  If the CD contains a data track,
try using the Read Time Range
tab instead with a slightly increased From time and a slightly decreased
To time to avoid accessing the data track.</li>
<li>If preview playback is intermittent, increase the "Read speed" and the
"Number of sectors per read" or reduce the "Number of sectors to overlap"
under the Options tab.</li>

<a name="Tool Cue Points"></a>
<h3>Cue Points</h3>

<p>Cue points mark and describe specific positions within sounds.  They have
numerous uses.  When recording speech, for example, you can use them to
hold information about the speaker or a translation of what the speaker said.
For music, you can store lyrics for each verse.  If you design instrument
samples, cue points can hold looping points.  Some multimedia applications
use them to play or loop specific sections of a sound.  When transferring
albums to CDs, cue points can mark track division points, which can be
used later to divide a large file into individual songs or tracks.

<p>Cue points are shown as inverted triangles in the cue points slot of
a Sound window, just above the time axis.  If two cue points overlap, the
colour of the cue point will be brighter.

<p class="warn">
<img class="warn" src="warn.png" alt="Warning">
Cue points are saved only in certain
<a href="#File Format">files types</a>.
</p>

<p class="warn">
<img class="warn" src="warn.png" alt="Warning">
Cue point are adjusted automatically when a file is edited, but not
when effects are applied.  Any effects that alters the length of the
selection, such as
<a href="#Time Warp">Time Warp</a> or
<a href="#Silence Reduction">Silence Reduction</a>, will cause the
cue points within the selection to be misplaced.</p>


<p>There are several ways to create a new cue point:
<ul>
<li> Use the New button on the Cue Points tool window,
then enter the name and position.</li>
<li> Right-click on the cue points slot in the Sound window
(see the <a href="#Figure Main Window">Main Window</a> figure)
and choose New Cue, then enter the name.  The position is already
set based on where you clicked the mouse.</li>
<li> Play the file and press Ctrl+Q or use
<a href="#Drop Cue">Edit&nbsp;|&nbsp;Cue&nbsp;Point&nbsp;|&nbsp;Drop&nbsp;Cue</a>
to set a cue point at
the current playback position.  This also works while recording.</li>
</ul>

<p>To edit an existing cue point, you can:
<ul>
<li> Select the cue point from the list in the Cue Points tool window
and choose the Edit button.</li>
<li> Right-click on the cue point in the Sound window and choose Edit Cue.</li>
<li> To change a cue point's position, drag-and-drop it
to the new position in the Sound window's cue point slot.</li>
</ul>

<p>To delete a cue point, you can:
<ul>
<li> Select the cue point from the list in the Cue Points tool window and choose the Delete button.</li>
<li> Right-click on the cue point in the Sound window and choose Delete Cue.</li>
</ul>

The Delete All button removes all cue points in the file.
Use this button before using the Auto Cue button if you
want to remove all existing cue points before automatically generating
new ones.

<p>Additional menu commands are provided to move cue points to the start or
finish marker's position or vice versa.  Right-click on a cue point in the
list to display the menu.

<p>Click on a column header to sort cue points by number, position, or name.

<p>Select a cue and use the F4 key start playback at that cue.  Press F8 to
 stop playback.

<div class="in">
<p><b>Copy All Button</b><br>
Use this button to copy all the cue point information into the clipboard.  You
can paste this into a text editor, such as the Notepad accessory.

</p>
<a name="Split File Button"></a>
<p><b>Split File Button</b><br>

The Split File button divides a large file onto smaller files using the cue
points as split positions.  If you've recorded one side of an album and
need to divide it into individual songs, for example, you would set a cue
point at the start of each song, then use this feature to automatically
create separate files for each song.  Each file can then be written to a
CD-R disc as a separate audio track using CD Recorder software.

<p class="note">
<img class="note" src="note.png" alt="Note">
Use the
Auto Cue button (below) to automatically set cue points at silences
between songs.</p>

<p> The Split File window options are given in the following table.

tracks.
<p>Note that if the end of the last track file does not contain enough audio to
perfectly fill a CD sector, a tiny section of audio (usually silence)
may be discarded for alignment.  If the file does not end in silence you

in each split file, if possible.  If the <tt>Track number</tt>
is set to <tt>##</tt>, GoldWave replaces it with a sequential number based
on the order in which the files are split.  The first split file
will have a track number of 1, then the next file will have 2, etc.



<p><b><a name="Auto Cue Button">Auto Cue Button</a></b><br>
Use the Auto Cue button to automatically create cue points.  It operates
in two modes: Mark Silence and Spacing.

<p class="note">
<img class="note" src="note.png" alt="Note">
The Split File button on the Cue Point window can be used later to
split a file into individual pieces based on these cue points.
</p>

<div class="in">
<p><b>Mark Silence Mode</b><br>
This mode sets cue points at silences, such as marking quiet sections between songs.
A single cue point is added in the center of each detected silent region.

<p>The <tt>Threshold</tt> value sets the <a href="#Volume Scales">volume</a>
level for the silence. In most cases, like vinyl recordings, the value
should be -40dB or higher so that any background hiss, pops, or clicks
are treated as silence.  Otherwise no silence would be marked at all.
If you find that no cue points appear, try increasing this value
to -30dB or higher.  If you find that too many points appear,
delete them, then decrease this value or change the values below.  Using
the <a href="#Pop/Click">Pop/Click</a> and
<a href="#Noise Reduction">Noise Reduction</a>
filters effect first may improve silence detection.

<p><tt>Silence length</tt> specifies how much silence is required
before it is marked.  Some songs contain brief silences that you usually
do not want marked.  This value helps to avoid marking any brief pauses
within a song.  Try values between 1.0 to 1.5 seconds to ignore these
brief silences and mark only the longer silences between songs.

<p><tt>Minimum separation between cues</tt> controls the minimum amount
of time between one cue point and the next.  If you know all the
songs are longer than 2 minutes, for example, then you can
set this value to 2:00 to ensure no silences within a song are
marked.  All cue points will be at least two minutes apart.

<p><tt>Cue placement within area</tt> specifies where to place
the cue point within the detected silent area.  A value of 0 means
at the beginning of the silence, a value of 100 means at the end of the
silence.  The default value of 50 places the cue point
in the center of the silence area.

<p><b>Spacing Mode</b><br>
This mode sets cue points at fixed intervals, such as having cue points every
5 minutes.  Cue points are added at the specific
interval, starting at the given time.

<p><tt>Start time</tt> sets the time to begin marking the file.  If you
enter 1:00, then the first cue point is inserted at time
00:01:00 in the file.  Normally this value would be zero.

<p><tt>Interval</tt> specifies the time interval to use between each
cue point.  A value of 5:00 would set cue points at five minute
intervals (00:05:00, 00:10:00, 00:15:00, etc.).

<p><b>Cue Naming</b><br>
The <tt>Cue naming</tt> options specify how cue points will be named as they
are added.  Select <tt>Time based</tt> to name
each cue point based on its time position within the file.  A cue
point added at two
minutes into the file, for example, will have the name 2:00.00000.

<p>Select <tt>Numbered</tt>
to sequentially number each cue point as they are added.  The
names will be 001, 002, 003, etc.  The starting number depends on how many
cue points are already in the file.

<p>Select <tt>Lettered</tt> to name each cue point alphabetically,
with three letters, such as AAA, AAB, AAC, etc.  The starting name depends
on how many cue points are already in the file.

</div>

<p><b>Import/Export Buttons</b><br>
Use the Import button to read cue points from a CD cue file.  Use the
Export button to save all cue points to a CD cue file.
The name of the cue file depends on the name of the current Sound
file.  For example, if the file you are working on is
"music.wav", then the cue file is "music.cue" by default.  See
<a href="#Options Storage">Options&nbsp;|&nbsp;Storage</a> for a setting
to use cue files automatically.

<p class="note">
<a name="Cue File"></a>
<img class="note" src="note.png" alt="Note">
A CD cue file contains track information that some CD Recorder programs,
such as CDRWIN and Nero, use when creating
a table of contents for a CD.  Creating a cue file may eliminate the need
to split a large file into separate track files.  You can open the cue
file in Notepad to edit or view its contents.
</p>

<p class="note">
<img class="note" src="note.png" alt="Note">
Cue point positions in a
cue file are accurate only to 1/75 of a second, which is the size
of a single CD sector.  They are stored more accurately within
some sound file types.

</div>

<a name="Tool Effect Chain Editor"></a>
<h3>Effect Chain Editor</h3>

The Effect Chain Editor allows a number of effects to be chained together so
they are all processed at once.  There are many advantages to using
chains, such as:
<ul>
<li> Easier automation, less work.  You can apply many effects
with just a few mouse clicks.</li>
<li> Less storage requirements.  Extra temporary storage is not
required for each effect in the chain.</li>
<li> Faster, more efficient processing.  Audio data is read
from storage, processed, then written to temporary storage
only once for the entire chain rather than for each effect.</li>
<li> Create new effects.  Chaining effects is a way of
creating new effects.</li>
<li> Advanced previewing.  Preview how a series of effects
will sound without ever having to process the entire file.</li>
</ul>

<p>The left window is a tree list showing all the effect plug-in modules,
with the GoldWave branch expanded initially.  Only effects that can be
chained are listed.  Effects requiring special access to the audio
data (like scans) or ones that are time based cannot be chained.

<p>You can drag-and-drop effects to the right "chain list" window or
select an effect and choose the Add button.  Effects are always added
to the end of the chain list.  Expand the branch of other listed modules
to use effects in those plug-ins.

<p>Use the Remove Last button to remove an effect from the chain
list.  Note that only the last effect in the list can be removed.
An effect in the middle of the list cannot be removed unless all
effects below it are removed first.  Use the Remove All button to
remove all effects in the chain list.

<p>When an effect is added to the chain list, it appears as a button.
Use the button to change settings for that effect.  Settings can be
changed while previewing the audio.

<p>When you have finished creating the chain, use the
<a href="#Presets">Presets</a>
controls near the bottom of the Effect Chain Editor window to save
the entire chain as a single preset.

<h3><a name="Tool File Merger">File Merger</a></h3>

<p>Use the File Merger tool to join together separate files into a single
file.  Add files to the list by using the <tt>Add Files</tt> button.  More
than one file can be added at a time by selecting multple files.
Files can be added via drag-and-drop or copy-and-paste from Windows
Explorer as well.  Use Ctrl+V on the keyboard to paste files.

<p>Remove a file by selecting it and choosing the <tt>Remove</tt> button.
The <tt>Remove All</tt> button removes all files from the list.

<p>Files are joined in the order they are listed.  Drag-and-drop files within
the list to change their order.

<p>Set the "Preferred sampling rate" for the merged file.  This rate is used
only if a rate is not specified in the attributes selected after you choose
the <tt>Merge</tt> button.  Many attributes have a predefined rate.  The
preferred rate will be ignored for those attributes.

<p>As each file is merged, a cue point is added at the junction point.
Check the <tt>Export cue file</tt> box to export these cue points to a separate
<a href="#Cue File">Cue File</a>.

<p>Choose the <tt>Merge</tt> button to specify a filename, a file type, and
attributes for the merged file.  Merge processing begins immediately
after you choose the <tt>Save</tt> button.

</p>
<a name="Options File Formats"></a>
<h3>File Formats</h3>

Use File Format Options to:
<ul>
<li> Associate a filename extension (such as .snd or .vox) with an audio type and attributes.</li>
<li> Change the precedence or enable and disable
<a href="#File Format Plug-ins">File Format Plug-ins</a>
used by GoldWave.</li>
<li> Set a default format for saving files.</li>
</ul>

These options are contained under separate tabs.

<div class="in">
<p><b>Undetectable Types Tab</b><br>
Use this feature to associate a filename extension with an audio type and
specific attributes.   This is useful for automatically opening files
that do not contain any information describing their format (raw files).
For example, if you work with Dialogic telephony files, you can associate
the .vox extension with a specific plug-in type.  In this case, you'd
use the Dialogic type, usually with "ADPCM 4 bit, 8000Hz, 32 kbps, mono"
attributes.  Whenever you open a .vox file, GoldWave will assume that
format without asking you to specify it each time.  This must be done
prior to using <a href="#Batch Processing">File&nbsp;|&nbsp;Batch&nbsp;Processing</a>
when working with raw files.

<p>The list shows all current associations, if any.  Use the Add button
to create a new association.  Use the Edit button to modify an existing
association.  Use the Remove button to remove an old association.

<div class="in">
<p><b>Example</b><br>
To associate .vox with Dialogic ADPCM decoding:

<ol>
  <li> Choose <b>File Formats</b> from the <b>Options</b> menu.</li>
  <li> Choose the <b>Undetectable Types</b> tab.</li>
  <li> Choose the <b>Add</b> button.</li>
  <li> Enter "vox" in the <b>Extension</b> box.  Do not enter a leading
period.</li>
  <li> Select "Dialogic (vox)" from the <b>File type</b> drop down list.
  <li> Select "ADPCM 4 bit, 8000 Hz, 32 kbps, mono" from
the <b>Attributes</b> drop down list.
  <li> Choose the OK button.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>See <a href="#Digital Audio Attributes">Appendix A</a> for additional
information about file attributes.

<p><b>File Plug-in Precedence Tab</b><br>
Use this feature to change the order that audio files are passed to
plug-ins for opening, or to enable and disable plug-ins.  By default all
plug-ins found in the File plug-in folder are listed and enabled, with
the built-in GoldWave plug-in listed first.

<p>Select an item in the list and use the Lower and Higher buttons to
change the order.  The plug-in at the top of the list is the first
one to be given the opportunity to open a file, if it recognizes the
format.  Otherwise, the file is passed to the next plug-in and so
on until the file can be opened or no plug-ins are left.  See
<a href="#File Format Plug-ins">File Format Plug-ins</a>
for more information.  Check or uncheck an item to enable or
disable that plug-in module.

<p><a name="Default Save Format"><b>Default Save Format Tab</b></a><br>
Use this feature to set a default save format for new files when
using the <a href="#Save">File&nbsp;|&nbsp;Save</a>
command.  The same format can be used for all "save" related commands
(<a href="#Save As">Save As</a>,
<a href="#Save Selection As">Save Selection As</a>, etc.) if
you check the "Use this format for..." box.  Use the
<tt>Save as type</tt> drop down list to select the type first, then use the
<tt>Attributes</tt> drop down list to select specific attributes.  Whenever you
create and save a file, this format will be selected by default.
Note that when creating a new file, you can select
attributes (sampling rate and number of channels) that differ from
the default save format.  Be sure to select appropriate attributes
to avoid conversions later when saving.

<p>The "Do not allow other file types..." option disables the file type
and attributes boxes under "save" related commands to prevent them
from being changed.  It forces the use of the default format.
</div>

<h3><a name="Options Keyboard">Keyboard</a></h3>

<P>Use Keyboard Options to set keyboard assigments (shortcuts) for
functions in GoldWave.  The list of the current assignments is given in
the window with the function in the left column and the assigned shortcut in the
right column.  Use the arrow keys to move between items.  To change a shortcut,
move to right column for the function shortcut you want to change and type
out the full text of the new
combination of keystrokes, such as "Ctrl+Shift+Up", "X", "Ctrl+P", "Shift+Enter", etc.

<p class="note">
<img class="note" src="note.png" alt="Note">
Note that the Left, Right, Page Up, and Page Down keys are used for navigation
and scrolling the view and should not be reassigned.  Combinations of these
keys with Ctrl and Shift are also reserved.
</p>

<p>Choose <tt>OK</tt> to save and use keyboard assigments.  Use the <tt>Defaults</tt>

<a name="Options Storage"></a>
<h3>Storage</h3>

<p>The Storage Options window configures folders, file storage, and
undo levels.  See the
<a href="#Storage Overview">Storage Overview</a>
section for additional information.

<div class="in">
<p><b>Sound Folder</b><br>
This specifies the folder to use when you start GoldWave.  The
<a href="#Open">File&nbsp;|&nbsp;Open</a>
command lists files in this folder whenever you start GoldWave.
You can make GoldWave remember the last folder used or always
start in the given folder.  Use the folder button to browse
for a folder.

<p><b>Temporary Storage</b><br>
This controls how GoldWave stores audio, as explained
in the <a href="#Storage Overview">Storage Overview</a> section.
When using hard drive storage, you need to specify the folder to use when
creating temporary files.  This folder should be located on a large,
local hard drive with plenty of free space.  Changing this folder does
not affect opened files already in temporary storage.
Use RAM storage only when working with small files for faster, efficient
editing.

<p><b>Undo Levels</b><br>
This sets the number of edits/changes you can undo. A value of 5
means you can undo the five most recent changes performed on
the file.  A value of 0 means that you cannot undo any
changes. Larger values use much more storage to store the
previous audio data.  When using the RAM storage option, this
should be set to a small value.  Otherwise RAM may be depleted
quickly and system performance will degrade.

<p><b>Cue Points Storage</b><br>
Use the "Automatically import and export separate cue file" setting
to automatically save or load cue points from a separate
<a href="#Cue File">cue file</a> when
saving or opening a sound file.  If you open a file named "music.mp3"
cue points are imported from a "music.cue" file, if it exists.
If you save a file named "music.mp3", cue points are saved
in a "music.cue" file (overwriting any existing file).
Automatic import and export is done only for file formats that cannot
store cue point information internally.  Cue files are not saved
automatically for other file formats (such as <tt>.wav</tt>).  Use the
<a href="#Tool Cue Points">Cue Points Tool</a> to manually import
or export a cue file.

<a name="Options Tool Bar"></a>
<h3>Tool Bar</h3>

<p>The Tool Bar Options let you customize GoldWave's tool bars.  Initially the
top tool bar contains main menu commands, while the lower tool
bar contains only effect commands.  Select an item and use the Add
and Remove buttons or drag-and-drop items between the Available and
Current lists to control the layout of the tool bars.  The
order which items appear in the Current list is the same as the
order they will appear on the tool bar.  You can drag-and-drop
items within the Current list to rearrange them.

<p> Use the Visible checkbox to show or hide the entire tool bar.  Use
the Gray-scale checkbox to convert the coloured images to
blank-and-white.  Use the Captions checkbox to display text within the
Main tool bar buttons.  Use the "Tool bar images in menu" checkbox to
display images in GoldWave's main menu.  Do not check this option if
screen reader accessibility is required.

<p>You can drag-and-drop the tool bars themselves within GoldWave's
Main window to change their locations.  Click-and-hold on the vertical
bumps near the left edge of the tool bar to drag it.

<a name="Options Window"></a>
<h3>Window</h3>

<p>Use Window Options to configure the positions of
the Main and Sound windows, set axis options, specify preset and
initial zoom values, and set miscellaneous options.

<div class="in">
<p><b>Main Window Size</b><br>
This controls the Main window's position and size when GoldWave
is started.  <tt>Normal</tt> gives control to Windows.  <tt>Maximize</tt> makes
the Main window occupy the entire screen.  <tt>Save position</tt> saves the
Main window's position and size when GoldWave is closed so that
it will appear in the same location next time.

<p><b>Sound Window Size</b><br>
This controls the position and size of Sound windows.  <tt>Normal</tt>
gives control to Windows, which usually results in cascaded
windows.  <tt>Maximize</tt> makes a Sound window occupy the entire
Main window.  <tt>Auto-tile</tt> resizes all Sound  windows whenever a
new sound is opened or closed so that every one is visible.
Arrangement is the same as the
<a href="#Window Cascade, Tile, Minimize, Arrange">Window&nbsp;|&nbsp;Tile&nbsp;Horizontally</a>
command.

<p><b>Y Amplitude Axis Numbering</b><br>
Displays or sets the units of the vertical axis in Sound windows.
Selecting <tt>Off</tt> hides the axis completely.  <tt>Normalized</tt> shows an
axis with a range of -1.0 to 1.0.  <tt>Signed 16 bit</tt> shows an axis
ranging from -32768 to 32767, which is the range of a 16 bit
sample.  <tt>Unsigned 8 bit</tt> shows an axis with a range of 0 to 255.

<p><b>X Time Axis Numbering</b><br>
Sets the format for displaying the horizontal time axis near the
bottom of Sound windows.  "Hours : minutes : seconds"
gives the time as three sets of numbers separated by colons, such as 12:23:56.
"Minutes : seconds" gives the time as two sets of numbers
separated by colons, such as 1234:56.  <tt>Seconds</tt> gives the time as a
floating point number, such as 1234.56.

<p><b>Zoom</b><br>
The <tt>Preset</tt> zoom value is used to for the <a href="#Preset">View&nbsp;|&nbsp;Preset</a>
command.  See <a href="#Specify">View&nbsp;|&nbsp;Specify</a> for more information about
zoom values.  The <tt>Initial</tt> zoom specifies the zoom level to use when
a file is opened.  If you choose <kbd>All</kbd>, then the entire waveform is
shown using whatever zoom level is required.

<p><b>Miscellaneous</b><br>
If the "Always confirm before saving" option is checked, you are
asked to confirm saving whenever you use the
<a href="#Save">File&nbsp;|&nbsp;Save</a> command.

<p>If the "Draw overview graph" option is checked, then the overview
is graphed based on audio from the file.  Otherwise it is drawn as
simple lines, which is quicker since the entire file does not have to
be scanned.

<p>If the "Use left and right mouse button selection method"
option is checked, then the start marker is set by using the left mouse
button and the finish marker is set by using the right mouse button.
No context menu appears.  You will not be able to use the new
right-click-and-drag features.  This is the way older versions of
GoldWave worked.

<p>If the "Update default effect settings after each use" options
is checked, then the last settings you use for an effect will
be used the next time the effect window is shown.  Essentially the
"Default" preset is automatically updated when you choose the
OK button on an effect window.

<h1>Appendix A: An Introduction to Digital Audio</h1>

<a name="Digital Audio Basics"></a>
<h2>Digital Audio Basics</h2>

In the digital world, everything is reduced to an on or off state so
that it can be stored in computer memory as a single <em>bit</em>
of information: 1 or 0.
Complex real world things, like images and audio, cannot be directly
represented in such a simple manner.  An image is rarely composed
of black and white dots and audio is rarely just on or off.

<p>Reducing images and audio to a digital state requires an
analog-to-digital conversion.  Instead of using just one bit of
information, many bits are used to more accurately store the
state.  By using 2 bits, for example, four states are possible:
00, 01, 10, 11. For images, that could be black (00), dark gray (01), light
gray (10), and white (11).  For audio, that would give four different
levels of loudness.  Typically, many more bits are used.  Most computer
video cards use 16 to 32 bits to store a single dot.  Sound cards
typically use 16 bits for audio levels.

<p>The number of bits to use depends on human perception and
bit alignment within computers.  Computer tend to bundle bits in
groups of 8, called bytes, so using 8, 16, 24,
or 32 bits would fit nicely in 1, 2, 3, or 4 bytes respectively.  For images,
16 bits do not provide enough states to make the transition from one state
to the next imperceptible, so 24 or more bits
are used.  For
audio, 16 bits are adequate, which is what a CD contains, but
audio systems using 24 bits will be common in the future.

</p>
<a name="Sample"></a>
<h3>Samples</h3>

<p>Digital audio is composed of thousands of numbers, called samples.
Each sample holds the state, or <a href="#Amplitude">amplitude</a>
(loudness), of a sound at a given instant
in time.  For images, each point of light,
or pixel, has a certain brightness and location and all pixels combine to
make a picture (see figure below).  For digital audio, all the samples
combine to make a waveform of the sound.

<p><center><img src="sample.png" width="123" height="88" alt="Samples"><br>
Figure: Samples</center>

<p> When playing audio, each sample specifies the
position of the speaker at a certain time.  A small number moves the
speaker in and a large number moves
the speaker out.  This movement occurs thousands of times per second,
causing vibration, which we hear as sound.

</p>
<a name="Digital Audio Attributes"></a>
<h2>Digital Audio Attributes</h2>

<p>There are several attributes that determine the quality and size of a digital
audio file.  They are the
<a href="#Sampling Rate">sampling rate</a>, the
<a href="#Bits">bit depth</a>, the number of
<a href="#Channels">channels</a>, and the
<a href="#Bitrate">bitrate</a>.

</p>
<a name="Sampling Rate"></a>
<h3>Sampling Rate</h3>
<p>The <em>sampling rate</em> is the number of times, per second, that
the amplitude level (or state) is captured.  It is measured in
Hertz (seconds<sup>-1</sup>, Hz).  A high sampling
rate results in high quality digital sound in the
same way that high resolution video shows better picture
quality.  Compact disks, for example, use a
sampling rate of 44100Hz, whereas telephone systems use a rate of only
8000Hz.  If you've ever heard music on the telephone while on hold,
you'll notice a big difference in quality when compared to the
original music played on a CD player.

<p>Higher sampling rates capture a wider range of
<a href="#Frequency Ranges">frequencies</a> and
maintain a smoother
waveform.  The figure below shows a real world waveform in red and
the digital waveform in black at different sampling rates.  You can
see that increasing the sampling rate makes each step of the digital
waveform narrower.  The shape more closely follows the
real world.  In general, the height of each step is reduced
as well, but that depends on the number of <a href="#Bits">bits</a>.
In simple terms, the sampling rate controls the width of each step.

<p><center><img src="samplingrate.png" width="469" height="104" alt="Sampling Rate"><br>
Figure: Sampling Rate</center>

<p>The rate to use depends upon the type of sound and the amount of storage
space available.  Higher rates consume a
lot of space.  In the above example, the CD requires over 5 times
the amount of storage as the telephone system for the same digital sound.
Certain types of sounds can be recorded at lower rates without loss of
quality.  Some standard rates are listed in the table.

<a name="Bits"></a>
<h3>Bits</h3>
<p>As explained in the <a href="#Digital Audio Basics">Digital Audio Basics</a>
section, the number of <em>bits</em> determines how accurately the
amplitude of the waveform is captured.  The figure below shows a real world
waveform in red and the corresponding digital waveforms with 2 bit samples
and 3 bit samples.

<p><center><img src="bits.png" width="376" height="119" alt="Bits"><br>
Figure: Bits</center>

<p>You can see that adding a single bit greatly improves
the way the digital waveform conforms to the real world waveform.  The
2 bit waveform looks like a rough approximation with large steps.
Several amplitudes are rounded to the same state, such as samples
9 through 11.  This is a
source of <a href="#Quantization">quantization noise</a>, explained later.

<p>In the 3 bit waveform, no amplitudes are rounded to the same state.
Each step is half the height of the 2 bit waveform, but it is still not
perfect.  From sample 1 to sample 2, there is a jump in the waveform,
which also causes <a href="#Quantization">quantization noise</a> to
a much lesser extent.
You'll notice that samples 0 and 1 are below the real waveform and
samples 2 and 3 are above the waveform.  This occurs because there are
no in-between states to accurately store those amplitude levels, so
the digital waveform ends up straddling the real one.
Therefore more states, and bits, are needed.

<p>8&nbsp;bit and 16&nbsp;bit samples are common.  In an 8&nbsp;bit
sample, there are 256 different states or levels of amplitude.
16&nbsp;bit samples have 65,536 levels.  This makes a huge difference
it terms of sound quality. Audio stored as 8&nbsp;bit samples will often
have much more <a href="#Quantization">quantization noise</a>.

</p>
<div class="in">
<p><a name="Signed and Unsigned"></a>
<h4>Signed and Unsigned</h4>

<p>Samples can be stored as bits a couple of different ways.  One way is
to consider all the states as positive, with no values below zero.
As shown in the figure above, the states 00, 01, 10, and 11 are
the same as the positive numbers 0, 1, 2 and 3.  This eliminates the need
for a negative sign.  Such samples are called <em>unsigned</em>.
For 8 bit samples, the states would range from 0 to 255.

<p>The other way is to use a form known as <em>two's complement</em>,
which allows both positive and negative values.
These samples are called <em>signed</em>.  Since real world waveforms tend
to fluctuate through a range of positive and negative values, signed
samples are preferred.  For 16 bit samples, the states would range
from -32678 to 32767.

</p>
<a name="Big and Little Endian"></a>
<h4>Big and Little Endian</h4>

<p>When a sample is stored using more than 8 bits, more than one byte is needed.
The term <em>endian</em> is used to describe the way bytes are
ordered in computer memory.  It specifies the significance of the first byte
in the group.  A 16 bit sample, for example,
requires exactly two bytes, byte A and byte B.  They can be stored as
A first, then B or as B first, then A.  Generally a PC will store them
one way and a Mac will store them the other way due to differences in
the internal processor design of those systems.

<p>Big endian order has the most significant byte stored first, making
it similar to the way we read numbers.  In the number 47,
the 4 is first and is most significant and the 7 is last and is least
significant.  This ordering is used on Mac systems.

<p>Little endian order has the least significant byte stored first, allowing
some optimizations in processing.  This ordering is used on Intel and
PC systems.
</div>

<a name="Channels"></a>
<h3>Channels</h3>

<p>Digital audio can have one or more channels.  Single channel audio,
referred to as a monaural (or mono) audio, contains information for only
one speaker and is similar to AM radio.  Two channel audio, or stereo
audio, contains data for two speakers or two ears, much like FM stereo.
Stereo sounds
can add depth, but they require twice as much storage and processing time
as mono sounds.  Most movie theatres have advanced audio systems with
4 or more channels, which are capable of making sounds appear to come
from certain directions.  GoldWave currently supports mono and stereo
audio only.

</p>
<a name="Digital Limitations"></a>
<h2>Digital Audio Limitations</h2>

<p>Since digital audio is limited by the sampling rate, the number of
bits, and the number of channels, a digital waveform can never be an
exact replica of the real world waveform.  These limitations
can lead to a number of problems, such as aliasing, clipping,
and quantization noise.

</p>
<a name="Aliasing"></a>
<h3>Aliasing</h3>

<p><em>Aliasing</em> occurs when the sampling rate is not high enough to
correctly capture the shape of the sound wave.  The recorded sound will
have missing tones (Figure: Aliasing, top) or new tones that never existed in the
original sound (Figure: Aliasing, bottom).  These problem can be eliminated by
using higher sampling rates or by using anti-aliasing filters.

<p><center><img src="aliasing.png" width="281" height="271" alt="Aliasing"><br>
Figure: Aliasing</center>

<p>Higher sampling rates increase the number of sampling points.  To see how
this works, try adding a three points between each sampling point in the
figure and redraw the graph.  The recorded sound will more closely
resemble the input.

<p>Anti-aliasing filters remove all tones that cannot be sampled correctly.  They
prevent high pitched tones from being aliased to low pitch.  Many sound
cards include anti-aliasing filters in hardware.

</p>
<a name="Clipping"></a>
<h3>Clipping</h3>

<p><em>Clipping</em> errors occur when the level is too high
to be stored in the bits available.  For example, if the maximum level for a 16
bit sample is 32767, and the actual level is 40000, then it
must be clipped to 32767 to fit (see the figure).  This
generates distortion. To eliminate clipping, adjust the recording volume before
recording.  By using the Control window's
<a href="#monitor input">Monitor input</a> feature, you can adjust
the volume to a suitable level.  The volume is low enough when
the VU Meter visual does not reach the top of the red region.

<p><center><img src="clipping.png" width="218" height="170" alt="Clipping"><br>
Figure: Clipping</center>

<p> Clipping can occur when processing effects, such as increasing the
volume with the <a href="#Change Volume">Change Volume</a> effect.
GoldWave does not clip audio internally, but it has to be clipped
when sending the audio to the sound card or when saving a
file.  You should use the
<a href="#Maximize Volume">Maximize Volume</a> effect with
a 0dB setting before saving to ensure that no clipping occurs in the
file.

</p>
<a name="Quantization"></a>
<h3>Quantization</h3>

<p>The real world has
an infinite number of states, but the digital world has a very limited
number of states.  <em>Quantizing</em> is process of assigning an amplitude
to this limited quantity of states. <em>Quantization noise</em>
occurs when an amplitude is rounded to the nearest state for the given
number of bits.  This is illustrated
in the <a href="#Bits">Bits</a> section.  Using 2 bits causes
large rounding errors and only roughly follows the real waveform.  Using
3 bits has much smaller rounding errors, but is still nowhere near as
smooth as the real world waveform.  Using 8 bits gives a much smoother
waveform, but the round errors can still be heard.  Using 16 bits gives
errors so small that they are almost imperceptible.

</p>

<h3><a name="Noise">Noise</a></h3>

<p>To minimize internal and external noises, make sure your sound card is
installed as far away from your graphics card as possible.  If the sound
hardware is integrated into the computer's main board, consider purchasing
and installing a separate sound card instead.  Integrated hardware tends
to have a much higher noise level.

<p>Keep all microphones and audio cables away from your monitor,
computer case, or other sources of electrical noise.
Use shielded cables and make sure everything has a common ground connection.
Plug equipment and devices into the same power strip so that they share
the same ground.  Equipment without a grounded plug (three pronged plug)
may require special grounding.  Sometimes rotating the plug helps reduce a
hum or buzz.

<p>System configuration can also affect audio quality.
Due to architectural problems with PCs and excessive virtual
memory swapping by Windows, you may notice an occasional gap when
recording.  Restarting Windows, updating the sound driver, shutting
down all other programs, or
installing more RAM helps to minimize that problem.

</p>
<a name="Volume Scales"></a>
<h2>Volume Scales</h2>

<p>The waveform levels or states can be interpreted in a number of
different ways.  Reading the states in their binary form is
impractical, so the states are mapped to different scales that
are more human-readable.  These include a simple amplitude scale,
a percentage scale, and a decibel scale.  As the figure shows,
a 1.0 amplitude level is the same as a 100% level and
a 0dB level.

<p><center><img src="volumescales.png" width="362" height="179" alt="Volume Scales"><br>
Figure: Volume Scales</center>

<a name="Amplitude"></a>
<h3>Amplitude (y)</h3>

<p>The amplitude scale simply maps the states to a linear range of -1.0 to
+1.0, with zero being silence.  The amplitude typically is given
as a positive value when used in effects.

</p>
<a name="Percent"></a>
<h3>Percent (%)</h3>

<p>The percent scale is 100% at the maximum and 0 at silence.  It is
essential the same as the amplitude scale converted to a percentage
by multiplying by one hundred and adding a percent sign.

</p>
<a name="Decibel"></a>
<h3>Decibel (dB)</h3>

<p>The decibel scale is unusual in that it is 0dB at the maximum
and negative infinity at silence.  It is a logarithmic scale, which
is closer to the way human hearing perceives sound levels.
You'll notice from the
above figure that there are no positive levels.  Levels below
the maximum are negative.  Only values above the maximum are positive
(not shown).
When changing the volume, positive values increase the level and
negative values decrease the level.

<p>Use the equation below to convert a decibel level to a percentage level.

<p><center><img src="db.png" width="277" height="49" alt="Decibel Equation"><br>
</center>

<a name="Relative vs. Absolute"></a>
<h3>Relative vs. Absolute</h3>

<p> When setting the volume in an effect, the value may be interpreted
as a relative level or an absolute level.  When changing the volume,
it is usually relative.  When specifying a threshold, it is usually absolute.

Relative changes are cumulative.  So if you apply a volume
change with 0.5 amplitude (50% or -6.02dB), then the amplitude
decreases to half its current level.  If you apply that change
again, then it decreases to one quarter of its original level.  In
other words, the change is relative to its current level.  Given an
original amplitude of A, the first change yields a result
of A&nbsp;x&nbsp;0.5 and the sample is replaced by that value.  The
second change takes that value and multiplies it by 0.5 again,
so we get the final result of (A&nbsp;x&nbsp;0.5)&nbsp;x&nbsp;0.5
or A&nbsp;x&nbsp;0.25.  Most of
the effect settings in GoldWave are cumulative.  For relative changes,
using 1.0, 100%, or 0dB does not alter the sound at all.

<p>Absolute levels are used in places where a threshold is required,
such as in
<a href="#Silence Reduction">Silence Reduction</a>, or in rare
cases were the absolute level is set, such as
<a href="#Maximize Volume">Maximize Volume</a>.  Absolute changes
are not cumulative.  If you maximize the sound
with 0.5 amplitude (50% or -6.02dB), then that is
what the peak level will be no matter how many times the effect is
used.  For absolute changes, using 1.0, 100%, or 0dB may alter the sound if
it is not currently at that level.

</p>
<a name="Frequency and Pitch"></a>
<h2>Frequency and Pitch</h2>

<p>Sound windows in GoldWave show sound as a waveform of amplitudes on
a time axis.  However, sound can be viewed in an entirely different way by
examining its frequency and pitch content or <em>frequency spectrum</em>.
Sounds are broken down into a combination of simple
fundamental (sinusoidal) tones, each with a different frequency.  This
is useful for examining bass and treble levels or for isolating and
studying certain sounds.

</p>
<a name="Frequency Ranges"></a>
<h3>Frequency Ranges</h3>

<p>Average human hearing spans a frequency range from about 20Hz to about
17000Hz. The figure below shows some common sounds and the frequency range
they cover.

<p><center><img src="frequencyrange.png" width="387" height="292" alt="Frequency Range of Sounds"><br>
Figure: Frequency Range of Sounds</center>

<p class="note">
<img class="note" src="note.png" alt="Note">
Many people wonder why it is difficult to remove vocals from
music.  From the figure, you'll see there is a large overlap in the
frequency range of speech and music.  Removing the vocals would
also remove a significant part of the music.  A similar problem
occurs when removing hiss noise, since it often covers the entire
spectrum.
</p>

<p>Most basic stereo systems have bass and treble controls, which offer limited
control over a frequency spectrum.  Bass applies to low frequency sounds,
such as drums, cellos, low piano notes, or a hum noise.  Treble applies to
high frequency sounds, such as a clash of cymbals, a tweet of a small bird,
high notes on a piano, or a hiss noise.

<p>More expensive stereo systems have Graphic Equalizers, which provide
better control over a frequency spectrum.  Instead of controlling just two
bands (bass and treble), you can control many bands.

<p>GoldWave provides even more control over frequency spectrums with filter
effects such as
<a href="#Parametric EQ">Parametric EQ</a>,
<a href="#Low/Highpass">Low/Highpass</a>,
<a href="#Bandpass/stop">Bandpass/stop</a>,
<a href="#Equalizer">Equalizer</a>,
and <a href="#Noise Reduction">Noise Reduction</a>.

</p>
<a name="Frequency Range and Sampling Rate"></a>
<h3>Frequency Range and Sampling Rate</h3>

<p>The frequency range of a digital sound is limited by its sampling rate.  In
other words, a sound sampled at 8000Hz cannot record frequencies above
8000Hz.  In fact, the sound cannot even have frequencies above 4000Hz.
According to the sampling theorem, the maximum frequency is limited to
half the sampling rate.  Any higher frequencies will be
<a href="#Aliasing">aliased</a>, to lower ones, causing noise if
appropriate filters are not used.

<p>CD audio is designed to cover the full range of human hearing, which has
a maximum of under 22kHz.  In order to successfully record this range,
the sampling theorem states that a sampling rate of at least twice
the maximum must be used, so a rate of at least 44kHz is required.  The
actual rate is 44100Hz for standard CD players.

</p>
<a name="Frequency Spectrum Graphs"></a>
<h3>Frequency Spectrum Graphs</h3>

<p>Several of GoldWave's Control visuals convert
sounds into a range of frequency bands using a radix-2 fast Fourier
transform (FFT) algorithm.  When the results are drawn using colours, the
graph is referred to as a spectrogram.  When the results are drawn with lines,
it is often referred to as a frequency spectrum or <em>frequency analysis</em>.

<p>Frequency analysis graphs are displayed in the
<a href="#Noise Reduction">Noise Reduction</a>
and
<a href="#Parametric EQ">Parametric EQ</a>
filter effects.  These help you to locate frequencies that you
want to remove or enhance.

<p>GoldWave applies a windowing function to the data before
performing the FFT
(see <a href="#Visual Properties">Control Visual Properties</a> section).
This reduces "discontinuity" errors that occur when dividing data into small
chunks.  A Kaiser window is used by default.

<p>To make the spectrum more realistic to human hearing, magnitudes are
scaled logarithmically.  This means that if one frequency "sounds" twice as
loud as another, it is graphed with twice the height (or the
corresponding colour for the spectrogram).

</p>
<a name="File Compression"></a>
<h2>File Compression</h2>

<p>Uncompressed audio files tend to be large.  CD quality audio requires
ten megabytes per minute.  That is not a problem with large computer
hard drives available today, but it is a problem if you want to save many
songs on a portable player or if you want to transfer files over
the Internet.  Unlike most computer data, audio data does not compress
very well using typical compression methods such as those found in
programs like PKZIP or WinZip.  These methods preserve the
data exactly so there is no loss of quality.  Such compression is
called <em>lossless</em> compression.

<p>To make audio files smaller, complex algorithms have to used.  Most
of these algorithms sacrifice some quality so that when the data
is decompressed, you do not get exactly the same quality you had
originally.  This type of compression is known as <em>lossy</em>
compression.  Ideally the quality that is lost is not perceptible,
so you do not notice the difference.

<p>The most common method of lossy audio compression is MPEG Layer-3,
better known as MP3.  It is capable of getting near CD quality audio
in less than one tenth the size, which is about one megabyte per
minute.  More recent algorithms, such as
<a href="http://www.vorbis.com">Ogg Vorbis</a> and
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia">Windows Media Audio</a>,
get even better quality in a smaller size.

<p>Software and hardware that compress audio using complex
algorithms are referred to as <em>codecs</em> (from
<b>co</b>der/<b>dec</b>oder).  Compression is the same as encoding
and decompression is the same as decoding.
</p>
To control the level of compression in GoldWave, use
<a href="#Save As">File&nbsp;|&nbsp;Save As</a> and select a different
file type and/or attributes.  The lower the
<a href="#Bitrate">bitrate</a> (the <em>kbps</em> number, see below),
the smaller the file will be, usually at reduced quality.

<p class="warn">
<img class="warn" src="warn.png" alt="Warning">
When opening, editing, and saving a file repeatedly, it is best
to use a lossless file format.  Every time a lossy compressed file is
re-opened and saved, some quality is lost.  For long term editing,
use the Wave type with "PCM 16 bit" attributes or one of the lossless
compressed formats such as FLAC or Windows Media Audio with "lossless"
attributes.</p>

<a name="Bitrate"></a>
<h3>Bitrate</h3>

<p>Many compressed audio formats measure the compressed size as
a <i>bitrate</i>.  The bitrate is the number of bits per second
(bps) required to store the audio.   Usually the number
is given in kilobits or one thousand bits.  Divide that number
by 8 to determine the number of kilobytes required per second.

<p>Internet connection
speed (bandwidth) is often measured in bitrates as well.  A 56k modem
is capable of receiving 56 kilobits per second.  If you want people
to stream your MP3 audio over a modem, you'll need to compress
the file using a maximum bitrate of 56kbps.  Due to the
connection overhead and Internet protocol, a lower rate
would have to be used to ensure the audio can be downloaded fast
enough.  For DSL and Cable Internet connections, the standard
128kbps MP3 rate can be used.

<p>Audio files can contain a wide range of sounds, from noisy
cymbal clashes to silence.  Algorithms typically
get much better compression on silence or simple audio sections
than on complex, noisy audio.  This means that the bitrate
depending on whether constant bitrate or variable bitrate compression
is used.

<p>
<a name="Constant Bitrate"></a>
<h3>Constant Bitrate</h3>
When using constant bitrate, each section of audio compresses
to exactly the same size, regardless of the content.  If the
audio contains silence, then the data may be padded to fill the
required bitrate.  If the audio contains complex music, then
quality may be decreased until it fits within the bitrate.
<p>Constant bitrate is useful for broadcast systems where the
transmission rate is fixed.  It also make is easy to seek
to arbitrary positions within the audio stream or file.

<p>
<a name="Variable Bitrate"></a>
<h3>Variable Bitrate</h3>
Variable bitrate compression uses the smallest size possible
for each section of audio.  If the audio contains silence, then
the bitrate will be very low.  If the audio contains complex
music, the bitrate will be at its maximum.
<p>Variable bitrate gives the best compression and
quality.  However, it makes it difficult to seek within
the stream or file since there is no direct relation between
time and size.

<a name="Appendix: Expression Evaluator"></a>
<h1>Appendix C: Expression Evaluator</h1>

<a name="Overview"></a>
<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The Expression Evaluator is a versatile tool for manipulating and generating
audio data.

<p>The <tt>Destination</tt> box specifies the Sound window where results of the evaluation will
be stored.  The drop down list contains all Sound windows in the form "<em>X</em> -
<em>Filename</em>", where <em>X</em> is the wave
identifier number of the Sound window.
For example, a Sound window with the title
"Hello.wav" could appear as "1&nbsp;-&nbsp;Hello.wav" in the list.  By
default, the destination is set to the current Sound window.  You can change
the destination, if more than one Sound window is opened, by using the up
and down keys or by selecting it with the mouse from the drop down list.

<p>The <tt>Source</tt> box lists currently opened Sound windows.  By selecting a source from this list, the function
<tt>wave<em>X</em>(n)</tt> is placed in the expression.  <em>X</em> is the wave identifier number,
as explained above.

<p>The large <tt>Expression</tt> box located at the top of the window is
where an expression is entered.  A list of valid operations and functions is
given in a following section.  In most cases, expressions will be some
function of <em>n</em> or <em>t</em>, just as in regular
math, where <em>y</em> is usually a function of <em>x</em>
(i.e. <em>y = f(x)</em>).  In the expression evaluator, we can have <em>destination = f(t)</em>,
where <em>f(t)</em> is any expression you enter.

<p>To create a simple tone, for example, you would enter the expression
"<tt>sin(600*t)</tt>".  You can even alter an existing sound.  To double the volume
of "1&nbsp;-&nbsp;Hello.wav", for example, you would select it as the destination
and enter the expression "<tt>wave(n)*2</tt>".

<p>To enter an expression, you can:

<ul>
  <li> Type it in using the keyboard, or</li>
  <li> Select it from the Presets tree list</li>
</ul>

<p>The evaluator uses several special variables, which you can initialize in the
"Incremented variables" and "User constants" groups.  These variables are
discussed later.

<p>After you have specified the destination, expression, and initial values,
choose the Play button to preview it.
Choose the OK button (or just press the <tt>Enter</tt> key) to begin evaluation.
If you entered an expression incorrectly, a message will be displayed.  If
the expression is valid, a processing window will appear.
Since the evaluation process takes time, you can stop it at any time with the
Cancel button.  No changes will be made to the sound if you cancel processing.

<p class="note">
<img class="note" src="note.png" alt="Note">
You can copy, cut and paste expression in the Expression box using
the usual keystrokes (Copy = Ctrl+C, Cut = Ctrl+X, Paste =
Ctrl+V).  You can also copy and paste expression from the online
help.
</p>

<p class="note">
<img class="note" src="note.png" alt="Note">
To speed up evaluation, make sure that you are using RAM storage
(see <a href="#Options Storage">Options&nbsp;|&nbsp;Storage</a>).
</p>

<a name="Evaluation Range, Variables, and Constants"></a>
<h2>Evaluation Range, Variables, and Constants</h2>

<p>Knowledge of the structure of digital audio is essential to understand how
the evaluator works.  To illustrate this structure, let's assume we have the
following sound:

<pre>
Title bar:          Hello.wav
Total length:       2.0 seconds
Sampling rate:      8000Hz
Start marker:       0.5 seconds
Finish marker:      1.2 seconds
</pre>

<p><center><img src="evalinternal.png" width="591" height="126" alt="File Structure"><br>
Figure: Internal Structure of Hello.wav, 8000Hz, 2 Seconds</center>

<p>Digital audio is stored as a series of amplitudes, which are often referred to
as <a href="#Digital Audio Basics">samples</a> (see figure).  The evaluator interprets each sample as a value
between -1 and 1, inclusive.  Only samples between the start and finish markers
are considered valid; all other values are assumed to be zero.  The number
of samples selected is defined as <em>N</em>.

<p>Each sample has a relative index number, <em>n</em>, and a time, <em>t</em>.  Since the time
of each sample depends on the sampling rate, it is usually written in terms
of the unit of time between each sample, <em>T</em>.  You many have noticed that the
time, <em>t</em>, is related to the index number, <em>n</em>, by the
equation <em>t=nT</em>.  The figure
shows how all these variables relate to the structure of the sound.

</p>
<a name="Using Time in an Expression"></a>
<h3>Using Time in an Expression</h3>

<p>Let's assume we have entered the expression "<tt>sin(t)</tt>".  Since expressions are
evaluated over the selection range, the initial value for <em>t</em> is automatically set
to start marker's position of 0.5.  Choosing the OK button evaluates
the expression from <em>t</em> = 0.5 to <em>t</em> = 1.2 in steps of 1/8000 of a
second, as defined by <em>T</em>.  This means that the expression is calculated for
each sample in the selection, changing each sample as follows:

<p>
<div class="exp">
Sample<sub>4000</sub> = sin(0.500000)<br>
Sample<sub>4001</sub> = sin(0.500125)<br>
Sample<sub>4002</sub> = sin(0.500250)<br>
...<br>
Sample<sub>9600</sub> = sin(1.200000)<br>
</div>

<a name="Using the Sample Index in an Expression"></a>
<h3>Using the Sample Index in an Expression</h3>

<p>The sample index is useful for modifying an existing sound.  If we want to
double the amplitude of Hello.wav, for example, we need to multiply
each sample by two and store it back into the sound.  In this case,
Hello.wav will be both the destination and the source.  To set it as the
destination, we simply select it from the <tt>Destination</tt> list.
To use it as a
source, we need to determine its wave identifier number.  These numbers
are provided in the <tt>Source</tt> list.  Assuming it
is listed as "3 - Hello.wav",
we now know that its wave identifier number is 3.  This number is necessary
for the evaluator's <tt>wave</tt> function, which has the following syntax:

<p>
<table align=center border=0>
<tr valign=top>
	<td><tt>waveX( n )</tt></td>
	<td width=20></td>
	<td>where:</td>
	<td><tt>X</tt> = wave identifier number<br>
	<tt>n</tt> = sample index number
	</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p class="note">
<img class="note" src="note.png" alt="Note">
Note that when the destination and the source are the same,
no number is needed after the <tt>wave</tt> function.  If
"<tt>wave(n)</tt>" is used, then the destination sound is assumed
to be the source.
</p>

<p class="note">
<img class="note" src="note.png" alt="Note">
In the evaluator, the index number, <em>n</em>, is <em>relative</em> to the start marker.
This means that the start markers position is added to the index
number (i.e. <em>n</em>+Start).  For the example in the figure above, a relative
index of <em>n</em>=0 has an absolute index of 4000.
</p>

<p>The final expression is "<tt>wave3(n)*2</tt>".  Choosing OK evaluate this
expression from <em>n</em>=0 to <em>n</em>=5600 in steps of 1
(note that <em>N&nbsp;=&nbsp;5600</em>) .  This
produces the following changes (remember than <em>n</em> is relative to
the start marker's position):

<p>
<div class="exp">
Sample<sub>4000</sub> = Sample<sub>4000</sub> * 2<br>
Sample<sub>4001</sub> = Sample<sub>4001</sub> * 2<br>
Sample<sub>4002</sub> = Sample<sub>4001</sub> * 2<br>
...<br>
Sample<sub>9600</sub> = Sample<sub>9600</sub> * 2<br>
</div>

<p>Note that <em>N</em> and <em>n</em> are always integers.  The evaluator rounds indices to the
nearest integer, so the expression "<tt>wave3(.7)</tt>" would be calculated as
"<tt>wave3(1)</tt>".

<p>You can use the sample index number and the <tt>wave</tt> function to mix two or
more wave together.  If you have several sounds opened, you can obtain the
wave identifier number for each sound from the <tt>Source</tt> list.  If
the sounds you wanted to mix were identified as 2 and 3, you would enter the
expression:

<p>
<div class="exp">
wave2(n) + wave3(n)
</div>

<p>Care must be taken when indexing signals with different sampling rates.
If <tt>wave1</tt> is a voice recorded at 11025Hz and <tt>wave2</tt> is music
recorded at 22050Hz, then with <tt>wave1</tt> as the destination
you'd need to use this expression to correctly mix them:

<p>
<div class="exp">
wave1(n) + wave2(n*2)
</div>

<p>Ideally, <tt>wave2</tt> would have to be low-pass filtered first.
If <tt>wave2</tt> is the destination, the expression would be:

<p>
<div class="exp">
wave1(n/2) + wave2(n)
</div>

<p>The variable <i>N</i> has several uses, such as reversing a sample.
If <tt>wave2</tt> is a new sound that has the same sampling rate and
length of <tt>wave1</tt>, then setting the destination to <tt>wave2</tt>
and using the expression

<p>
<div class="exp">
wave1(N-n)
</div>

<p>makes <tt>wave2</tt> the reverse of <tt>wave1</tt>.

</p>
<a name="User Constants"></a>
<h3>User Constants x, y, and f</h3>

<p>User constants can be set to any values you choose.  None of these values
change during evaluation.  They just provide a way of easily changing
parameters within an expression without having to edit the expression
directly.  The constant <i>f</i> is typically used for frequency values.
By using the expression

<p>
<div class="exp">
y*sin(2*pi*f*t)
</div>

<p>you can generate any tone by specifying the frequency in the <tt>f</tt>
box and the amplitude in the <tt>y</tt> box.

</p>
<a name="Conversion Between Variables"></a>
<h3>Conversion Between Variables</h3>

<p>The following equations convert between time and sample index number.
The <em>start</em> value is the position of the start marker (in seconds).

<p>
<div style="font-family:monospace">
n = (t - <i>start</i>) / T<br>
t = nT + <i>start</i><br>
T = 1 / (<i>sampling rate</i>)<br>

<a name="Custom Filters"></a>
<h2>Custom Filters</h2>

<p>One way to create your own digital filter is to use Matlab<small><sup>TM</sup></small>
(<u>The Student Edition of Matlab</u>, by The Math Works Inc., published by
Prentice-Hall, ISBN 0-13-855974-0).  It has many built-in commands that
generate filter coefficients.  The coefficients can then used in the Expression
Evaluator command.

<h3>Example of a Low-Pass Filter</h3>

<p>In preparation for down-sampling, you can use Matlab to generate the
coefficients of a 4th order Butterworth low pass filter that will remove noise
above half the Nyquist frequency (one quarter the sampling rate).  Enter:

<p>
<pre>
[b,a] = butter(4, 0.5)
</pre>

<p>The result should be similar to:

<pre>
b =  0.0940  0.3759  0.5639  0.3759  0.0940
a =  1.0000  0.0000  0.4680  0.0000  0.0177
</pre>

<p>To implement this filter in the evaluator, assume that the sound to be
filtered is in the Sound window titled Sound.wav.

<ol>
  <li> Use <a href="#New">File&nbsp;|&nbsp;New</a> to create a new Sound window with the same
sampling rate and channels as Sound.wav.</li>
  <li> Make sure the length of the new sound is as long (or longer) than
Sound.wav.</li>
  <li> Use <a href="#Appendix: Expression Evaluator">Tool&nbsp;|&nbsp;Expression Evaluator</a>
   to open the expression evaluator window.</li>
  <li> Set the destination to the new sound.</li>
  <li> Enter the following expression (assuming Sound.wav has a wave
identifier of 1):
<pre>
	wave1(n)*0.0940 + wave1(n-1)*0.3759 +
	wave1(n-2)*0.5639 + wave1(n-3)*0.3759 +
	wave1(n-4)*0.0940 - wave2(n-2)*0.4860 -
	wave2(n-4)*0.0177
</pre></li>
  <li> Choose OK to start filtering.</li>

<h2>From Turntable to CD-R</h2>
This tutorial explains the steps required to record from
a turntable, restore the audio, and split the recording into tracks
so it can be burned to a blank CD.

<a name="Tutorial1 Make Connections"></a>
<h3>Make Connections</h3>

<p>Unless your turntable has a built-in amplifier or a headphone
output, you'll need an external amplifier, receiver, or preamp to boost the
turntable output.  The figure below shows all the connections required.
You may need two RCA cables with male connectors and a RCA to 1/8" miniplug
stereo Y-adaptor cable.

<p>If you have not connected your headphones or speakers to your computer,
do so before proceeding.

<p><center><img src="turntableconnect.png" width="623" height="101" alt="Connections"><br>
Figure: Connections</center>

<div class="in">
<p><b>Step 1</b><br>
Connect the turntable output to Phono-in on a receiver or to the input
of a preamp, as shown.
<p>

<hr>
<p><b>Step 2</b><br>
Connect the receiver or preamp audio output to the light blue
Line-In socket on your computer.  It is marked with an arrow pointing
into the rings, as shown.

<p class="warn">
<img class="warn" src="warn.png" alt="Warning">
Make sure you connect to the correct socket on your computer.
If you accidentally plug the receiver/preamp output into the computer's
speaker socket you may damage the hardware.  Connect your
speakers or headphones to your computer first.
</p>
</div>

<a name="Tutorial1 Setup Recording"></a>
<h3>Setup Recording</h3>

<div class="in">

<p><b>Step 1</b><br>
Take some time to thoroughly clean the album and carefully inspect and clean
the stylus.
Also review the information about avoiding <a href="#Noise">Noise</a>.
Eliminating noise before it is recorded saves a lot of restoration
work later and gives much better quality in the end.
<p>

<hr>
<p><b>Step 2</b><br>
Run GoldWave, then press the F11 key or use the
<a href="#Properties">Options&nbsp;|&nbsp;Control&nbsp;Properties</a>
command, then select the Device tab.  Make sure the correct
playback and recording devices are selected.  Usually the default
settings are fine, unless you have more than one sound device.
<p>

<hr>
<p><b>Step 3</b><br>
Select the Record tab on the Control Properties window, then check the
<a href="#monitor input">Monitor input</a> box.  This will activate
the visuals on the Control window so you can adjust volume levels
whithout having to record.
<p>

<hr>
<p><b>Step 4</b><br>
Select the Volume tab on the Control Properties window.  Make sure
the correct Volume device is selected.  It should be the same as
the recording device.

<p><center><img src="volumeproperties.png" width="433" height="325" alt="Control Properties"><br>
Figure: Volume Properties</center>

<p>Check the Select box for the Line (or Line In) item.
Make sure the volume level is at least 50 initially.  Make sure no
other items are checked as they could be a source of
noise.  Choose OK to close the
Control Properties window so that all new settings are used.
<p>

<hr>
<p><b>Step 5</b><br>
Play the album on your turntable to ensure that all the connections
are good and that the input level is set correctly.  The Level Visual
in the Control window should occasionally touch the red region.  If you
find that the Level Visual goes too high or never goes above the green
region, then adjust the volume as explained in step 4.  Note that
the volume fader on the Control window only changes the playback
volume.  You must adjust the recording volume under the Volume
tab of the Control Properties window.

<p><center><img src="control.png" width="614" height="288" alt="Control Window"><br>
Figure: Control Window</center>

<p>If you
get no activity at all, check all connections, make sure your
receiver/preamp is turned on, and make sure the correct recording
device and volume source are selected as explained in steps 2 to
4.  Check to see if your amplifier or preamp has an output level control
that needs to be adjusted.
<p>

<hr>
<p><b>Step 6</b><br>
Use the <a href="#New">File&nbsp;|&nbsp;New</a> command and
select one of the "CD Audio" preset quality setting.  Enter the initial length
for the recording, such as 25:00 to record the entire side of the
album.  Note that you can use the
<a href="#unbounded mode">Unbounded</a> recording mode to
record for any duration.
<p>

<hr>
<p><b>Step 7</b><br>
Click the red
<img src="record.png" width="33" height="17" align="bottom" alt="">

GoldWave.  Start playing the thoroughly cleaned, dust free album on
the turntable. Press the
red <img src="recstop.png" width="33" height="17" align="bottom" alt="">
stop button to stop recording when done.
<p>

<hr>
<p><b>Step 8</b><br>
Play the recording to see how it sounds.  If you are not satisfied with
the quality, make volume adjustments, re-clean the album, check connections,
etc.  Use <a href="#Undo">Edit&nbsp;|&nbsp;Undo</a> to undo the recording
and start recording again.  If the quality is satisfactory, continue to
the next step.
<p>

<hr>
<p><b>Step 9</b><br>
Trim any leading and trailing silences by selecting the entire file with the
<a href="#Select All">Edit&nbsp;|&nbsp;Select All</a> command,
followed by the <a href="#AutoTrim">Edit&nbsp;|&nbsp;AutoTrim</a> command.
Depending on how noisy the recording is, a threshold of &minus;30dB or greater may
be needed.  Start with &minus;40dB.  If you still see flat areas on the ends of
the waveform, increase it to &minus;30dB.

<p>If the recording is very noisy, manual trimming may be required.
To do that, use <a href="#10 Seconds">View&nbsp;|&nbsp;10 Seconds</a>.
Right-click on the waveform to set the start selection marker to
a position a second or so before the music begins.  Click on the timeline
to start playback to check the position.  Scroll to the
end of the recording by using the scroll bar below the waveform.
Right-click to set the finish selection marker at a position a second or
so after the music ends (where the waveform goes flat).  Use
<a href="#Trim">Edit&nbsp;|&nbsp;Trim</a> to remove the
silences on either end of the selection.
<p>

the track files to a blank CD as audio tracks.  Note that you cannot
just copy the files to the CD using Windows Explorer.  That will
just create a data track.  Each song must be written as a separate
audio track.

<a name="Common Questions and Answers"></a>
<h2>Common Questions and Answers</h2>

<p><b>Why do I get only silence when I try to record?</b>

<p>	You have to select the correct recording source.  See
<a href="#Volume Properties">Volume Properties</a> tab under
<a href="#Properties">Control Properties</a>.

<p><b>How do I record from an audio CD?</b>

<p>	If you have a SCSI or MMC compliant CD-ROM drive (most are), use
the <a href="#Tool CD Reader">Tool&nbsp;|&nbsp;CD&nbsp;Reader</a>
command.
If you want to record using your sound card, you need to select the
CD-ROM as the recording source for your sound card.  See
<a href="#Recording Sounds">Recording Sounds</a> for more information.

<p><b>How can I see and adjust recording volume levels without recording?</b>

<p>	Use the <a href="#monitor input">Monitor input</a> option
under the <a href="#Record Properties">Record Properties</a> tab.

<p><b>How can I avoid stuttering and glitches in recording?</b>

<p>Do not use disk compression.  Set visuals to Blank.  Close
all other programs.  Restart your system before (or between) recording for
long periods of time.  Update your sound driver.

<p><b>How do I select part of a sound?</b>

<p>	See <a href="#Editing Overview">Editing Overview</a> for
more information.

<p><b>How can I tell if the finish marker is in the right place without playing
the entire selection?</b>

<p>	Right click on the waveform just before the finish marker and choose
the "Play from here" menu item.  Or, go to the
<a href="#Play Properties">Play Properties</a> tab and select the
<b>Finish</b> option for one of the play buttons.  That will play
a few seconds before the finish marker.

<p><b>How do I edit individual samples with the mouse?</b>

<p>	See <a href="#Redrawing the Waveform with the Mouse">Redrawing
the Waveform with the Mouse</a>.

<p><b>Why does GoldWave show the shareware messages?</b>

<p>	GoldWave is not free software.  If you are a licensed user and
are still seeing shareware messages, you'll need to enter your
license into the program again.  Directions for entering the
license are included with the license.

<p><b>Can I convert sound files to MIDI?</b>

<p>	No.  MIDI files do not contain digital audio.  They contain notes
and timing information for instruments.  In other words, they
contain instructions for playing the music, but not the music itself.

<p><b>How are you?</b>

<p>	Fine, thanks.

<p><b>How can I split a large recording into individual songs?</b>

<p>Use the <a href="#Tool Cue Points">Cue Points</a> tool with the
<a href="#Auto Cue Button">Auto Cue Button</a> and the
<a href="#Split File Button">Split File Button</a>.
